KARL:  This morning, a \"This Week\" exclusive, former Vice President \nDick Cheney, the administration's harshest critic... CHENEY:  The president's been largely silent.  Half-measures keep \nyou half-exposed.  The White House must stop dithering. KARL:  ... with no apologies of his own. CHENEY:  I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced \ninterrogation program. KARL:  National security, Iran, politics, and... BIDEN:  Iraq, I mean, it's going to be one of the great achievements \nof this administration. KARL:  ... Dick Cheney takes on the current vice president, only on \n\"This Week.\"  Then, a Washington thaw. OBAMA:  I'm going to spend some time listening. KARL:  But can bipartisanship survive the politics of the moment? PALIN:  We need a commander-in-chief, not a professor of law \nstanding at the lectern. KARL:  That and the rest of the week's politics on our roundtable \nwith George Will, Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations, the \nNew Yorker's Jane Mayer, and Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal. And as always, the Sunday funnies. LETTERMAN:  John McCain knew that it was Sarah Palin's birthday, and \nhe did something very nice for her.  He bought her a Toyota. (END VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER:  From the heart of the nation's capital, \"This Week\" with \nABC's congressional correspondent, Jonathan Karl, live from the Newseum \non Pennsylvania Avenue. KARL:  Joining me now, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Vice President, welcome to \"This Week.\" CHENEY:  Good morning, John. KARL:  Now, you have been unflinching in your criticism of this \nadministration's handling of terrorism, counterterrorism.  Most \nrecently, talking about the Christmas Day bomber, you said, \"It is clear \nonce again that President Obama is trying to pretend that we are not at \nwar.\"  Now, this morning, we have heard from the current vice president, \nJoe Biden, directly in response to that.      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN:  We're pursuing that war with a vigor like it's never been \nseen before.  We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people.  We have taken \nout 100 of their associates.  We are making -- we've sent them \nunderground.  They are, in fact, not able to do anything remotely like \nthey were in the past.  They are on the run.  I don't know where Dick \nCheney has been. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  Your response? CHENEY:  Well, my reference to the notion that the president was \ntrying to avoid treating this as a war was in relation to his initial \nresponse when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber... KARL:  Right. CHENEY:  ... up in Detroit, when he went out and said this was the \nact of an isolated extremist.  No, it wasn't.  And we found out over \ntime, obviously -- and he eventually changed his -- his assessment -- \nbut that, in fact, this was an individual who'd been trained by Al \nQaida, who'd been part of a larger conspiracy, and it was closer to \nbeing an act of war than it was the act of an isolated extremist. It's the mindset that concerns me, John.  I think it's -- it's very \nimportant to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling \nthese events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and \nthen looking at 9/11 and saying, \"This is not a criminal act,\" not when \nyou destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole \nin the Pentagon.  That's an act of war. KARL:  Well -- well... CHENEY:  And what the administration was slow to do was to come to \nthat -- that recognition that we are at war, not dealing with criminal \nacts.  And as I say, my response there dealt specifically to the fact \nthe president called it an isolated extremist.  It was not. KARL:  Well, I want to get to that notion of treating this as a law \nenforcement action, but what the administration will say is, look at \nwhat they have done, 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, doubling, \ntripling, and maybe even more the drone attacks on the tribal areas in \nPakistan on Al Qaida targets.  They say that they are actually \ndedicating more resources to the fight against Al Qaida than you were. CHENEY:  Well, I -- you know, I'm a complete supporter of what \nthey're doing in Afghanistan.  I think the president made the right \ndecision to send troops into Afghanistan.  I thought it took him a while \nto get there. Having Stan McChrystal now in charge in Afghanistan I think is an \nexcellent choice.  General McChrystal's one of the most able officers I \nknow.  I'm glad they're doing what they're doing in Afghanistan. I'm not \na critic of what they're doing, in terms of how they're dealing with \nthat situation. But I do see repeatedly examples that there are key members in the \nadministration, like Eric Holder, for example, the attorney general, who \nstill insists on thinking of terror attacks against the United States as \ncriminal acts as opposed to acts of war, and that's a -- that's a huge \ndistinction. KARL:  OK, before we get to Eric Holder, a couple more things from \nthe vice president.  He's been out responding preemptively to you.  One \nthing he said we heard in the open, that he believes Iraq may ultimately \nprove to be one of the greatest achievements of the Obama administration. CHENEY:  Well, I -- I guess I shouldn't be surprised by my friend, \nJoe Biden.  I'm glad he now believes Iraq is a success.  Of course, \nObiden and -- Obama and Biden campaigned from one end of the country to \nthe other for two years criticizing our Iraq policy. CHENEY:  They opposed the surge that was absolutely crucial to our \ngetting to the point we're at now with respect to Iraq.  And for them to \ntry to take credit for what's happened in Iraq strikes me as a little \nstrange.  I think if -- if they had had their way, if we'd followed the \npolicies they'd pursued from the outset or advocated from the outset, \nSaddam Hussein would still be in power in Baghdad today. So if they're going to take credit for it, fair enough, for what \nthey've done while they're there, but it ought to go with a healthy dose \nof \"Thank you, George Bush\" up front and a recognition that some of \ntheir early recommendations, with respect to prosecuting that war, we're \njust dead wrong. KARL:  Well, in fact, Vice President Biden says that he believes \nthat the war in Iraq was not worth it.  What do you say to that?  I \nmean, given the resources that were drawn away from the -- what you \ncould argue is the central front in Afghanistan, Pakistan, is he right \nabout that? CHENEY:  No.  I -- I believe very deeply in the proposition that \nwhat we did in Iraq was the right thing to do.  It was hard to do.  It \ntook a long time.  There were significant costs involved. But we got rid of one of the worst dictators of the 20th century. We \ntook down his government, a man who'd produced and used weapons of mass \ndestruction, a man who'd started two different wars, a man who had a \nrelationship with terror.  We're going to have a democracy in Iraq \ntoday.  We do today.  They're going to have another free election this \nMarch. This has been an enormous achievement from the standpoint of peace \nand stability in the Middle East and ending a threat to the United \nStates.  Now, as I say, Joe Biden doesn't believe that.  Joe Biden wants \nto take credit -- I'm not sure for what -- since he opposed that policy \npretty much from the outset. KARL:  I think what he wants to take credit for is taking resources \nout of Iraq, the fact... CHENEY:  That's being done in accordance with a timetable that we \ninitiated, that we -- that we negotiated with -- with the Iraqis.  I \nmean, that was our policy. KARL:  Another thing from the vice president, he also addressed the \npossibility of another 9/11-style attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN:  The idea of there being a massive attack in the United \nStates like 9/11 is unlikely, in my view.  But if you see what's \nhappening, particularly with Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, they \nhave decided to move in a direction of much more small-bore, but \ndevastatingly frightening attacks. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  Is he right? CHENEY:  I don't think so.  And I would point to a study that was \nreleased just within the last week or two up at the Kennedy School at \nHarvard by a gentleman -- Mowatt-Larssen's his name, I believe.  He was \nCIA for 23 years, director of intelligence at the Energy Department for \na long time, that looks at this whole question of weapons of mass \ndestruction and Al Qaida and comes to the conclusion that there's a very \nhigh threat that Al Qaida is trying very hard to acquire a weapon of \nmass destruction and, if they're successful in acquiring it, that they \nwill use it. I think he's right.  I think, in fact, the situation with respect to \nAl Qaida to say that, you know, that was a big attack we had on 9/11, \nbut it's not likely again, I just think that's dead wrong.  I think the \nbiggest strategic threat the United States faces today is the \npossibility of another 9/11 with a nuclear weapon or a biological agent \nof some kind, and I think Al Qaida is out there even as we meet trying \nto figure out how to do that. KARL:  And do you think that the Obama administration is taking \nenough serious steps to prevent that? CHENEY:  I think they need to do everything they can to prevent it.  \nAnd if the mindset is it's not likely, then it's difficult to mobilize \nthe resources and get people to give it the kind of priority that it \ndeserves. KARL:  OK, let's get to -- you mentioned Eric Holder, the treatment \nof the Christmas Day underwear bomber.  How do you think that case \nshould have been dealt with? CHENEY:  I think the -- the proper way to -- to deal with it would \nhave been to treat him as an enemy combatant.  I think that was the \nright way to go. The thing I learned from watching that process unfold, though, was \nthat the administration really wasn't equipped to deal with the \naftermath of an attempted attack against the United States in the sense \nthat they didn't know what to do with the guy. There was talk earlier after they'd dismantled the system we'd put \nin place for prisoner interrogation of high-value detainees. They'd gone \nout supposedly to create the HIG, high-value interrogation program, but \nin reality, it was not up and running at Christmastime when it should \nhave been.  It started months before that, to put that in place.      \nThey need a process, a set of institutions that they can fall back on.  \nAdmittedly, this is hard.  We had a hard time dealing with this.  You've \ngot the Supreme Court on one side that -- that is going to evaluate \neverything you do, and you've got to be careful with that. The Congress \ngets involved in it. CHENEY:  So I'm not saying it's an easy task, but by this point, \nwhen they've made all the decisions they've had, closed Guantanamo, end \n(ph) the high-value detainee program and so forth, I think those are all \nmistakes.  Those were the tools we put in place to deal with this kind \nof situation.  They should have had something to put in lieu of those \nprograms, and it would look like they do not have -- have that kind of \ncapability yet. KARL:  If you have somebody in custody like Abdulmutallab, after \njust trying to blow up an airliner, and you think he has information on \nanother attack, I mean, do you think that those enhanced interrogation \ntechniques should have been -- should have been used?  I mean, would you \n-- do you think that he should have been, for instance, subject to \neverything, including waterboarding? CHENEY:  Well, I think the -- the professionals need to make that \njudgment.  We've got people in -- we had in our administration -- I'm \nsure they're still there -- many of them were career personnel -- who \nare expects in this subject.  And they are the ones that you ought to \nturn somebody like Abdulmutallab over to, let them be the judge of \nwhether or not he's prepared to cooperate and how they can best achieve \nhis cooperation. KARL:  But you believe they should have had the option of everything \nup to and including waterboarding? CHENEY:  I think you ought to have all of those capabilities on the \ntable.  Now, President Obama has taken them off the table.  He announced \nwhen he came in last year that they would never use anything other than \nthe U.S. Army manual, which doesn't include those techniques.  I think \nthat's a mistake. KARL:  OK.  So -- so was it a mistake when your administration took \non the Richard Reid case?  This is very similar.  This was somebody that \nwas trying to blow up an airliner with a shoe bomb, and he was within \nfive minutes of getting taken off that plane read his Miranda rights, \nfour times, in fact, in 48 hours, and tried through the civilian \nsystem.  Was that a mistake? CHENEY:  Well, first of all, I believe he was not tried.  He pled \nguilty.  They never did end up having a trial. Secondly, when this came up, as I recall, it was December of '01, \njust a couple of months after 9/11.  We were not yet operational with \nthe military commissions.  We hadn't had all the Supreme Court decisions \nhanded down about what we could and couldn't do with the commissions. KARL:  But you still had an option to put him into military custody. CHENEY:  Well, we could have put him into military custody.  I don't \n-- I don't question that.  The point is, in this particular case, all of \nthat was never worked out, primarily because he pled guilty. KARL:  Now, I'd like to read you something that the sentencing judge \nreading the -- giving him his life sentence read to Richard Reid at the \ntime of that sentencing.  Here it is.  He said to Reid, \"You are not an \nenemy combatant.  You are a terrorist.  You are not a soldier in any \nwar.  To give you that reference, to call you a soldier gives you far \ntoo much stature.  We do not negotiate with terrorists. We hunt them \ndown one by one and bring them to justice.\" The judge in that case was a Reagan appointee.  Doesn't he make a \ngood point? CHENEY:  Well, I don't think so, in a sense that it -- if it -- if \nyou interpret that as taking you to the point where all of these people \nare going to be treated as though they're guilty of individual criminal \nacts. I want to come back again to the basic point I tried to make at the \noutset, John.  And up until 9/11, all terrorist attacks were criminal \nacts.  After 9/11, we made the decision that these were acts of war, \nthese were strategic threats to the United States. Once you make that judgment, then you can use a much broader range \nof tools, in terms of going after your adversary.  You go after those \nwho provide them safe harbor and sanctuary.  You go after those who \nfinance and those who provide weapons for them and those who train \nthem.  And you treat them as unlawful enemy combatants. There's a huge distinction here in terms of the kinds of policies \nyou put in place going forward.  And what I'm most concerned about isn't \nso much argument about all the stuff in the past, about what happened to \nAbdulmutallab or Richard Reid.  I think the relevant point is:  What are \nthe policies going to be going forward? And if you're really serious and you believe this is a war and if \nyou believe the greatest threat is a 9/11 with nukes or a 9/11 with a \nbiological agent of some kind, then you have to consider it as a war, \nyou have to consider it as something we may have to deal with tomorrow.  \nYou don't want the vice president of the United States running around \nsaying, \"Oh, it's not likely to happen.\" KARL:  Now, on that question of trying, you know, dealing as enemy \ncombatants or through the criminal justice system, I came across this.  \nThis is a document that was put out by the Bush Justice Department under \nAttorney General Ashcroft... CHENEY:  Right. KARL:  ... covering the years 2001 to 2005.  And if you go right to \npage one, they actually tout the criminal prosecutions... CHENEY:  They did. KARL:  ... of terror suspects, saying, \"Altogether, the department \nhas brought charges against 375 individuals in terrorism- related \ninvestigations and has convicted 195 to date.\"  That was 2005. Again, \nseems to make the administration's point that they're not doing it all \nthat differently from how you were doing it. CHENEY:  Well, we didn't all agree with that.  We had -- I can \nremember a meeting in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White \nHouse where we had a major shootout over how this was going to be \nhandled between the Justice Department, that advocated that approach, \nand many of the rest of us, who wanted to treat it as an intelligence \nmatter, as an act of war with military commissions. We never clearly or totally resolved those issues.  These are tough \nquestions, no doubt about it.  You want my opinion, my view of what \nought to happen, I think we have to treat it as a -- as a war. This is a \nstrategic threat to the United States.  I think that's why we were \nsuccessful for seven-and-a-half years in avoiding a further major attack \nagainst the United States. And I do get very nervous and very upset when that's the dominant \napproach, as it was sometimes in the Bush administration or certainly \nwould appear to be at times in the new Obama administration. KARL:  Did you more often win or lose those battles, especially as \nyou got to the second term? CHENEY:  Well, I suppose it depends on which battle you're talking \nabout.  I won some; I lost some.  I can't... (CROSSTALK) KARL:  ... waterboarding, clearly, what was your... CHENEY:  I was a big supporter of waterboarding.  I was a big \nsupporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques that... KARL:  And you opposed the administration's actions of doing away \nwith waterboarding? CHENEY:  Yes. KARL:  I'd like to ask you about the big terror case now, which is \nthe KSM trial.  The administration very much wants to see the mastermind \nof 9/11 tried in civilian courts here in the United States. New York has \nobviously objected. Do you think that's going to happen?  Do you think this will be a \ncivilian trial?  Or are they not going to be able to do it? CHENEY:  It looks to me like they're going to have great difficulty \ndoing it in New York.  I mean, even the mayor's come out against it \nnow.  I think trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York's a big -- big \nmistake.  It gives him a huge platform to promulgate his -- his \nparticular brand of propaganda around the world. I think he ought to be at Guantanamo.  I think he ought to be tried \nat Guantanamo in front of a military commission.  They've got \ndifficulties now, because my guess is they don't want to send him back \nto Guantanamo, because that would validate, if you will, the value of \nGuantanamo.  They're trying to close it, clearly haven't been able to \nget it done. But my guess is, in the end, he'll end up being tried in front of a \nmilitary commission on a military facility some place. KARL:  So you think Guantanamo will be open when this president \nleaves office? CHENEY:  I wouldn't be surprised.  It's a valuable facility. There's \na reason why we set it up.  It makes good sense.  There's obviously \ngreat reluctance on Capitol Hill to appropriate the funds to close it \ndown.  I think -- I think Guantanamo is going to be there for quite a while. KARL:  And one other point -- I just want to read also from a \nprevious interview that you gave -- one of your points about Guantanamo \nis, if you release the hard-core Al Qaida terrorists, you said, that are \nheld at Guantanamo, I think they go back into the business of trying to \nkill more Americans and mount further mass casualty attacks.  If you \nturn them loose and they go kill more Americans, who's responsible for \nthat? And it's a real concern.  We've heard from the president's homeland \nsecurity adviser, John Brennan, saying that at minimum 10 percent of the \nmore than 500 that have been released from Guantanamo have gone back \ninto the fight. But Brennan also wrote this.  He said, \"I want to underscore the \nfact that all of these cases relate to detainees released during the \nprevious administration and under the prior detainee review process.\" In other words, all of those released from Guantanamo that have gone \nback into the fight were released by your administration.  Can't you \nmake the case that the Obama administration has actually been more \nresponsible about releasing who they release from Guantanamo? CHENEY:  I wouldn't make that -- I wouldn't make that case, John. I \nthink -- as I recall, the percentage that we had of the recidivists was \n12 percent.  And we released prisoners back basically to their home \ncountries, partly because the State Department was under enormous \npressure to do so, and there was an effort to try to return them.  The \nSaudis had a rehabilitation program for returned Saudis, and... KARL:  Did you oppose those releases? CHENEY:  I did.  I didn't think that releasing anybody was the right \nthing to do, unless you had evidence that, you know, there was a mistake \nof some kind or they'd been -- been before a commission and you'd \nreviewed their case and found that the case didn't stand up, and that \nwas usually the case.  They were put through a thorough scrub before \nthey were released. Obviously, some of them got through the filter.  But I think, out of \nthe ones that remain, those are the real hard core, and I think your \nrecidivist rate would be far higher than it was on those that have \nalready been released. It's a tough problem; I'll be the first to admit it.  But I think \nyou have to have a facility like Guantanamo to hold these individuals \nwho are members of Al Qaida, who've tried to kill Americans, and who -- \nwhen they're released, they'll go back out and try to kill Americans again. KARL:  I'd like to move to Iran.  Do you trust the Obama \nadministration to do what is necessary to keep Iran from getting nuclear \nweapons? CHENEY:  I remain to be persuaded. KARL:  Do you think that sanctions can work?  I mean, that's the \ntrack they've chosen. CHENEY:  Well, I think -- I hope sanctions work. KARL:  It's the same track you chose (ph). CHENEY:  We -- I certainly would hope sanctions would work, but I \nthink they're most likely to work if you keep the military option on the \ntable.  I don't think you want to eliminate the military -- the \npossibility of military action.  I think that's essential to give any \nkind of meaning at all to negotiations over sanctions. KARL:  How close did you come -- how close did the Bush \nadministration come to taking military action against Iran? CHENEY:  Well, I would -- some of that I can't talk about, \nobviously, still.  I'm sure it's still classified.  We clearly never \nmade the decision -- we never crossed over that line of saying, \"Now \nwe're going to mount a military operation to deal with the problem.\" The president was always hopeful -- and I think everybody else was, \ntoo -- that we could find a way to deal with it within having to resort \nto military force.  One of the problems that the Obama administration \ninherited was the Iranian problem, and it's a tough one. KARL:  David Sanger of the New York Times says that the Israelis \ncame to you -- came to the administration in the final months and asked \nfor certain things, bunker-buster bombs, air-to-air refueling \ncapability, overflight rights, and that basically the administration \ndithered, did not give the Israelis a response.  Was that a mistake? CHENEY:  I -- I can't get into it still.  I'm sure a lot of those \ndiscussions are still very sensitive. KARL:  Let me ask you:  Did you advocate a harder line, including in \nthe military area, in those -- in those final months? CHENEY:  Usually. KARL:  And with respect to Iran? CHENEY:  Well, I -- I made public statements to the effect that I \nfelt very strongly that we had to have the military option, that it had \nto be on the table, that it had to be a meaningful option, and that we \nmight well have to resort to military force in order to deal with the \nthreat that Iran represented.  The problem here being that a \nnuclear-armed Iran is a huge threat to that entire part of the world \nand, indeed, to the United States. KARL:  Was it -- was it a... CHENEY:  We never got to the point where the president had to make a \ndecision one way or the other. KARL:  Was that a mistake?  Was it a mistake to leave that nuclear \ncapability intact? CHENEY:  Well, we -- we did a lot, because we were very concerned \nabout nuclear capability in the hands of rogue states or potentially \nshared with terrorist organizations, and we were successful in taking \ndown, for example, Saddam Hussein, who had messed with nuclear weapons \ntwice previously, taking down the A.Q. Khan network, a black-market \noperation that was providing technology to the North Koreans, Iranians, \nand Libyans.  We successfully obtained all the Libyan materials for \ntheir nuclear program, so we got a lot done. We didn't get everything done.  We still -- when we finished, there \nstill was the ongoing Iranian problem and the ongoing North Korean \nproblem.  Both of them remain to be addressed. KARL:  I'd like to get your response to Sarah Palin's recent \ncomments on Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PALIN:  Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided really to \ncome out and do whatever he could to support Israel, which I would like \nhim to do, if he decided to toughen up and do all that he can to secure \nour nation and our allies, I think people would perhaps shift their \nthinking a little bit and decide, well, maybe he's tougher than we think \nhe -- than he is today. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  She's, of course, talking about President Obama, seemed to be \nimplying that this would be a good political move for him.  What's your \ntake? CHENEY:  I don't think a president can make a judgment like that on \nthe basis of politics.  The stakes are too high, the consequences too \nsignificant to be treating those as simple political calculations. When \nyou begin to talk about war, talk about crossing international borders, \nyou talk about committing American men and women to combat, that takes \nplace on a plane clear above any political consideration. KARL:  So... CHENEY:  So I'd be -- I'd be very cautious about treating that kind \nof issue on those kinds of conditions. KARL:  We're almost out of time.  We're going to get you very \nquickly on a few other subjects.  First of all, one more on Palin.  Is \nshe qualified to be president? CHENEY:  I haven't made a decision yet on who I'm going to support \nfor president the next time around.  Whoever it is, is going to have to \nprove themselves capable of being president of the United States.  And \nthose tests will -- will come during the course of campaigns, \nobviously.  I think -- well, I think all the prospective candidates out \nthere have got a lot of work to do if, in fact, they're going to \npersuade a majority of Americans that they're ready to take on the \nworld's toughest job. KARL:  OK, \"don't ask/don't tell\" -- you're a former defense \nsecretary -- should this policy be repealed? CHENEY:  Twenty years ago, the military were strong advocates of \n\"don't ask/don't tell,\" when I was secretary of defense.  I think things \nhave changed significantly since then.  I see that Don Mullen -- or Mike \nMullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has indicated his \nbelief that we ought to support a change in the policy. So I think -- my \nguess is the policy will be changed. KARL:  And do you think that's a good thing?  I mean, is it time to \nallow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military? CHENEY:  I think the society has moved on.  I think it's partly a \ngenerational question.  I say, I'm reluctant to second-guess the \nmilitary in this regard, because they're the ones that have got to make \nthe judgment about how these policies affect the military capability of \nour -- of our units, and that first requirement that you have to look at \nall the time is whether or not they're still capable of achieving their \nmission, and does the policy change, i.e., putting gays in the force, \naffect their ability to perform their mission? When the chiefs come forward and say, \"We think we can do it,\" then \nit strikes me that it's -- it's time to reconsider the policy. And I \nthink Admiral Mullen said that. KARL:  And, finally, I know that you have a reunion coming up later \nthis month with President Bush.  This'll be the first time you've seen \nhim since leaving office, face to face? CHENEY:  Pretty much, yes.  We talk on the telephone periodically, \nbut the first time I've seen him since January 20th. KARL:  What does he think of you being so outspoken in contrast to him? CHENEY:  Well, I don't think he's opposed to it, by any means. I'd \nbe inclined to let him speak for himself about it.  The reason I've been \noutspoken is because there were some things being said, especially after \nwe left office, about prosecuting CIA personnel that had carried out our \ncounterterrorism policy or disbarring lawyers in the Justice Department \nwho had -- had helped us put those policies together, and I was deeply \noffended by that, and I thought it was important that some senior person \nin the administration stand up and defend those people who'd done what \nwe asked them to do. And that's why I got started on it.  I'm the vice president now -- \nex-vice president.  I have the great freedom and luxury of speaking out, \nsaying what I -- what I want to say, what I believe.  And I have not \nbeen discouraged from doing so. KARL:  And that includes writing a book? CHENEY:  Writing a book, that's correct. KARL:  Can you give us -- before you go -- a quick nugget that's \ngoing to be in the book, give us the title, give us something going? CHENEY:  Have me back about a year from now, and I'll have a copy of \nthe book for you, John. KARL:  OK, it's deal. CHENEY:  All right. KARL:  Mr. Vice President, thanks a lot for joining us on \"This Week.\" CHENEY:  Good to see you.  I've enjoyed it. KARL:  The roundtable is next, George Will, Paul Gigot, Jane Mayer, \nand Peter Beinart.  And later, the Sunday funnies.  KARL:  Good morning, and welcome to \"This Week.\" CHENEY:  There is no middle ground. KARL:  This morning, a \"This Week\" exclusive, former Vice President \nDick Cheney, the administration's harshest critic... CHENEY:  The president's been largely silent.  Half-measures keep \nyou half-exposed.  The White House must stop dithering. KARL:  ... with no apologies of his own. CHENEY:  I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced \ninterrogation program. KARL:  National security, Iran, politics, and... BIDEN:  Iraq, I mean, it's going to be one of the great achievements \nof this administration. KARL:  ... Dick Cheney takes on the current vice president, only on \n\"This Week.\"  Then, a Washington thaw. OBAMA:  I'm going to spend some time listening. KARL:  But can bipartisanship survive the politics of the moment? PALIN:  We need a commander-in-chief, not a professor of law \nstanding at the lectern. KARL:  That and the rest of the week's politics on our roundtable \nwith George Will, Peter Beinart of the Council on Foreign Relations, the \nNew Yorker's Jane Mayer, and Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal. And as always, the Sunday funnies. LETTERMAN:  John McCain knew that it was Sarah Palin's birthday, and \nhe did something very nice for her.  He bought her a Toyota. (END VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER:  From the heart of the nation's capital, \"This Week\" with \nABC's congressional correspondent, Jonathan Karl, live from the Newseum \non Pennsylvania Avenue. KARL:  Joining me now, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Vice President, welcome to \"This Week.\" CHENEY:  Good morning, John. KARL:  Now, you have been unflinching in your criticism of this \nadministration's handling of terrorism, counterterrorism.  Most \nrecently, talking about the Christmas Day bomber, you said, \"It is clear \nonce again that President Obama is trying to pretend that we are not at \nwar.\"  Now, this morning, we have heard from the current vice president, \nJoe Biden, directly in response to that.      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN:  We're pursuing that war with a vigor like it's never been \nseen before.  We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people.  We have taken \nout 100 of their associates.  We are making -- we've sent them \nunderground.  They are, in fact, not able to do anything remotely like \nthey were in the past.  They are on the run.  I don't know where Dick \nCheney has been. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  Your response? CHENEY:  Well, my reference to the notion that the president was \ntrying to avoid treating this as a war was in relation to his initial \nresponse when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber... KARL:  Right. CHENEY:  ... up in Detroit, when he went out and said this was the \nact of an isolated extremist.  No, it wasn't.  And we found out over \ntime, obviously -- and he eventually changed his -- his assessment -- \nbut that, in fact, this was an individual who'd been trained by Al \nQaida, who'd been part of a larger conspiracy, and it was closer to \nbeing an act of war than it was the act of an isolated extremist. It's the mindset that concerns me, John.  I think it's -- it's very \nimportant to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling \nthese events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and \nthen looking at 9/11 and saying, \"This is not a criminal act,\" not when \nyou destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole \nin the Pentagon.  That's an act of war. KARL:  Well -- well... CHENEY:  And what the administration was slow to do was to come to \nthat -- that recognition that we are at war, not dealing with criminal \nacts.  And as I say, my response there dealt specifically to the fact \nthe president called it an isolated extremist.  It was not. KARL:  Well, I want to get to that notion of treating this as a law \nenforcement action, but what the administration will say is, look at \nwhat they have done, 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, doubling, \ntripling, and maybe even more the drone attacks on the tribal areas in \nPakistan on Al Qaida targets.  They say that they are actually \ndedicating more resources to the fight against Al Qaida than you were. CHENEY:  Well, I -- you know, I'm a complete supporter of what \nthey're doing in Afghanistan.  I think the president made the right \ndecision to send troops into Afghanistan.  I thought it took him a while \nto get there. Having Stan McChrystal now in charge in Afghanistan I think is an \nexcellent choice.  General McChrystal's one of the most able officers I \nknow.  I'm glad they're doing what they're doing in Afghanistan. I'm not \na critic of what they're doing, in terms of how they're dealing with \nthat situation. But I do see repeatedly examples that there are key members in the \nadministration, like Eric Holder, for example, the attorney general, who \nstill insists on thinking of terror attacks against the United States as \ncriminal acts as opposed to acts of war, and that's a -- that's a huge \ndistinction. KARL:  OK, before we get to Eric Holder, a couple more things from \nthe vice president.  He's been out responding preemptively to you.  One \nthing he said we heard in the open, that he believes Iraq may ultimately \nprove to be one of the greatest achievements of the Obama administration. CHENEY:  Well, I -- I guess I shouldn't be surprised by my friend, \nJoe Biden.  I'm glad he now believes Iraq is a success.  Of course, \nObiden and -- Obama and Biden campaigned from one end of the country to \nthe other for two years criticizing our Iraq policy. CHENEY:  They opposed the surge that was absolutely crucial to our \ngetting to the point we're at now with respect to Iraq.  And for them to \ntry to take credit for what's happened in Iraq strikes me as a little \nstrange.  I think if -- if they had had their way, if we'd followed the \npolicies they'd pursued from the outset or advocated from the outset, \nSaddam Hussein would still be in power in Baghdad today. So if they're going to take credit for it, fair enough, for what \nthey've done while they're there, but it ought to go with a healthy dose \nof \"Thank you, George Bush\" up front and a recognition that some of \ntheir early recommendations, with respect to prosecuting that war, we're \njust dead wrong. KARL:  Well, in fact, Vice President Biden says that he believes \nthat the war in Iraq was not worth it.  What do you say to that?  I \nmean, given the resources that were drawn away from the -- what you \ncould argue is the central front in Afghanistan, Pakistan, is he right \nabout that? CHENEY:  No.  I -- I believe very deeply in the proposition that \nwhat we did in Iraq was the right thing to do.  It was hard to do.  It \ntook a long time.  There were significant costs involved. But we got rid of one of the worst dictators of the 20th century. We \ntook down his government, a man who'd produced and used weapons of mass \ndestruction, a man who'd started two different wars, a man who had a \nrelationship with terror.  We're going to have a democracy in Iraq \ntoday.  We do today.  They're going to have another free election this \nMarch. This has been an enormous achievement from the standpoint of peace \nand stability in the Middle East and ending a threat to the United \nStates.  Now, as I say, Joe Biden doesn't believe that.  Joe Biden wants \nto take credit -- I'm not sure for what -- since he opposed that policy \npretty much from the outset. KARL:  I think what he wants to take credit for is taking resources \nout of Iraq, the fact... CHENEY:  That's being done in accordance with a timetable that we \ninitiated, that we -- that we negotiated with -- with the Iraqis.  I \nmean, that was our policy. KARL:  Another thing from the vice president, he also addressed the \npossibility of another 9/11-style attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN:  The idea of there being a massive attack in the United \nStates like 9/11 is unlikely, in my view.  But if you see what's \nhappening, particularly with Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, they \nhave decided to move in a direction of much more small-bore, but \ndevastatingly frightening attacks. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  Is he right? CHENEY:  I don't think so.  And I would point to a study that was \nreleased just within the last week or two up at the Kennedy School at \nHarvard by a gentleman -- Mowatt-Larssen's his name, I believe.  He was \nCIA for 23 years, director of intelligence at the Energy Department for \na long time, that looks at this whole question of weapons of mass \ndestruction and Al Qaida and comes to the conclusion that there's a very \nhigh threat that Al Qaida is trying very hard to acquire a weapon of \nmass destruction and, if they're successful in acquiring it, that they \nwill use it. I think he's right.  I think, in fact, the situation with respect to \nAl Qaida to say that, you know, that was a big attack we had on 9/11, \nbut it's not likely again, I just think that's dead wrong.  I think the \nbiggest strategic threat the United States faces today is the \npossibility of another 9/11 with a nuclear weapon or a biological agent \nof some kind, and I think Al Qaida is out there even as we meet trying \nto figure out how to do that. KARL:  And do you think that the Obama administration is taking \nenough serious steps to prevent that? CHENEY:  I think they need to do everything they can to prevent it.  \nAnd if the mindset is it's not likely, then it's difficult to mobilize \nthe resources and get people to give it the kind of priority that it \ndeserves. KARL:  OK, let's get to -- you mentioned Eric Holder, the treatment \nof the Christmas Day underwear bomber.  How do you think that case \nshould have been dealt with? CHENEY:  I think the -- the proper way to -- to deal with it would \nhave been to treat him as an enemy combatant.  I think that was the \nright way to go. The thing I learned from watching that process unfold, though, was \nthat the administration really wasn't equipped to deal with the \naftermath of an attempted attack against the United States in the sense \nthat they didn't know what to do with the guy. There was talk earlier after they'd dismantled the system we'd put \nin place for prisoner interrogation of high-value detainees. They'd gone \nout supposedly to create the HIG, high-value interrogation program, but \nin reality, it was not up and running at Christmastime when it should \nhave been.  It started months before that, to put that in place.      \nThey need a process, a set of institutions that they can fall back on.  \nAdmittedly, this is hard.  We had a hard time dealing with this.  You've \ngot the Supreme Court on one side that -- that is going to evaluate \neverything you do, and you've got to be careful with that. The Congress \ngets involved in it. CHENEY:  So I'm not saying it's an easy task, but by this point, \nwhen they've made all the decisions they've had, closed Guantanamo, end \n(ph) the high-value detainee program and so forth, I think those are all \nmistakes.  Those were the tools we put in place to deal with this kind \nof situation.  They should have had something to put in lieu of those \nprograms, and it would look like they do not have -- have that kind of \ncapability yet. KARL:  If you have somebody in custody like Abdulmutallab, after \njust trying to blow up an airliner, and you think he has information on \nanother attack, I mean, do you think that those enhanced interrogation \ntechniques should have been -- should have been used?  I mean, would you \n-- do you think that he should have been, for instance, subject to \neverything, including waterboarding? CHENEY:  Well, I think the -- the professionals need to make that \njudgment.  We've got people in -- we had in our administration -- I'm \nsure they're still there -- many of them were career personnel -- who \nare expects in this subject.  And they are the ones that you ought to \nturn somebody like Abdulmutallab over to, let them be the judge of \nwhether or not he's prepared to cooperate and how they can best achieve \nhis cooperation. KARL:  But you believe they should have had the option of everything \nup to and including waterboarding? CHENEY:  I think you ought to have all of those capabilities on the \ntable.  Now, President Obama has taken them off the table.  He announced \nwhen he came in last year that they would never use anything other than \nthe U.S. Army manual, which doesn't include those techniques.  I think \nthat's a mistake. KARL:  OK.  So -- so was it a mistake when your administration took \non the Richard Reid case?  This is very similar.  This was somebody that \nwas trying to blow up an airliner with a shoe bomb, and he was within \nfive minutes of getting taken off that plane read his Miranda rights, \nfour times, in fact, in 48 hours, and tried through the civilian \nsystem.  Was that a mistake? CHENEY:  Well, first of all, I believe he was not tried.  He pled \nguilty.  They never did end up having a trial. Secondly, when this came up, as I recall, it was December of '01, \njust a couple of months after 9/11.  We were not yet operational with \nthe military commissions.  We hadn't had all the Supreme Court decisions \nhanded down about what we could and couldn't do with the commissions. KARL:  But you still had an option to put him into military custody. CHENEY:  Well, we could have put him into military custody.  I don't \n-- I don't question that.  The point is, in this particular case, all of \nthat was never worked out, primarily because he pled guilty. KARL:  Now, I'd like to read you something that the sentencing judge \nreading the -- giving him his life sentence read to Richard Reid at the \ntime of that sentencing.  Here it is.  He said to Reid, \"You are not an \nenemy combatant.  You are a terrorist.  You are not a soldier in any \nwar.  To give you that reference, to call you a soldier gives you far \ntoo much stature.  We do not negotiate with terrorists. We hunt them \ndown one by one and bring them to justice.\" The judge in that case was a Reagan appointee.  Doesn't he make a \ngood point? CHENEY:  Well, I don't think so, in a sense that it -- if it -- if \nyou interpret that as taking you to the point where all of these people \nare going to be treated as though they're guilty of individual criminal \nacts. I want to come back again to the basic point I tried to make at the \noutset, John.  And up until 9/11, all terrorist attacks were criminal \nacts.  After 9/11, we made the decision that these were acts of war, \nthese were strategic threats to the United States. Once you make that judgment, then you can use a much broader range \nof tools, in terms of going after your adversary.  You go after those \nwho provide them safe harbor and sanctuary.  You go after those who \nfinance and those who provide weapons for them and those who train \nthem.  And you treat them as unlawful enemy combatants. There's a huge distinction here in terms of the kinds of policies \nyou put in place going forward.  And what I'm most concerned about isn't \nso much argument about all the stuff in the past, about what happened to \nAbdulmutallab or Richard Reid.  I think the relevant point is:  What are \nthe policies going to be going forward? And if you're really serious and you believe this is a war and if \nyou believe the greatest threat is a 9/11 with nukes or a 9/11 with a \nbiological agent of some kind, then you have to consider it as a war, \nyou have to consider it as something we may have to deal with tomorrow.  \nYou don't want the vice president of the United States running around \nsaying, \"Oh, it's not likely to happen.\" KARL:  Now, on that question of trying, you know, dealing as enemy \ncombatants or through the criminal justice system, I came across this.  \nThis is a document that was put out by the Bush Justice Department under \nAttorney General Ashcroft... CHENEY:  Right. KARL:  ... covering the years 2001 to 2005.  And if you go right to \npage one, they actually tout the criminal prosecutions... CHENEY:  They did. KARL:  ... of terror suspects, saying, \"Altogether, the department \nhas brought charges against 375 individuals in terrorism- related \ninvestigations and has convicted 195 to date.\"  That was 2005. Again, \nseems to make the administration's point that they're not doing it all \nthat differently from how you were doing it. CHENEY:  Well, we didn't all agree with that.  We had -- I can \nremember a meeting in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing of the White \nHouse where we had a major shootout over how this was going to be \nhandled between the Justice Department, that advocated that approach, \nand many of the rest of us, who wanted to treat it as an intelligence \nmatter, as an act of war with military commissions. We never clearly or totally resolved those issues.  These are tough \nquestions, no doubt about it.  You want my opinion, my view of what \nought to happen, I think we have to treat it as a -- as a war. This is a \nstrategic threat to the United States.  I think that's why we were \nsuccessful for seven-and-a-half years in avoiding a further major attack \nagainst the United States. And I do get very nervous and very upset when that's the dominant \napproach, as it was sometimes in the Bush administration or certainly \nwould appear to be at times in the new Obama administration. KARL:  Did you more often win or lose those battles, especially as \nyou got to the second term? CHENEY:  Well, I suppose it depends on which battle you're talking \nabout.  I won some; I lost some.  I can't... (CROSSTALK) KARL:  ... waterboarding, clearly, what was your... CHENEY:  I was a big supporter of waterboarding.  I was a big \nsupporter of the enhanced interrogation techniques that... KARL:  And you opposed the administration's actions of doing away \nwith waterboarding? CHENEY:  Yes. KARL:  I'd like to ask you about the big terror case now, which is \nthe KSM trial.  The administration very much wants to see the mastermind \nof 9/11 tried in civilian courts here in the United States. New York has \nobviously objected. Do you think that's going to happen?  Do you think this will be a \ncivilian trial?  Or are they not going to be able to do it? CHENEY:  It looks to me like they're going to have great difficulty \ndoing it in New York.  I mean, even the mayor's come out against it \nnow.  I think trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York's a big -- big \nmistake.  It gives him a huge platform to promulgate his -- his \nparticular brand of propaganda around the world. I think he ought to be at Guantanamo.  I think he ought to be tried \nat Guantanamo in front of a military commission.  They've got \ndifficulties now, because my guess is they don't want to send him back \nto Guantanamo, because that would validate, if you will, the value of \nGuantanamo.  They're trying to close it, clearly haven't been able to \nget it done. But my guess is, in the end, he'll end up being tried in front of a \nmilitary commission on a military facility some place. KARL:  So you think Guantanamo will be open when this president \nleaves office? CHENEY:  I wouldn't be surprised.  It's a valuable facility. There's \na reason why we set it up.  It makes good sense.  There's obviously \ngreat reluctance on Capitol Hill to appropriate the funds to close it \ndown.  I think -- I think Guantanamo is going to be there for quite a while. KARL:  And one other point -- I just want to read also from a \nprevious interview that you gave -- one of your points about Guantanamo \nis, if you release the hard-core Al Qaida terrorists, you said, that are \nheld at Guantanamo, I think they go back into the business of trying to \nkill more Americans and mount further mass casualty attacks.  If you \nturn them loose and they go kill more Americans, who's responsible for \nthat? And it's a real concern.  We've heard from the president's homeland \nsecurity adviser, John Brennan, saying that at minimum 10 percent of the \nmore than 500 that have been released from Guantanamo have gone back \ninto the fight. But Brennan also wrote this.  He said, \"I want to underscore the \nfact that all of these cases relate to detainees released during the \nprevious administration and under the prior detainee review process.\" In other words, all of those released from Guantanamo that have gone \nback into the fight were released by your administration.  Can't you \nmake the case that the Obama administration has actually been more \nresponsible about releasing who they release from Guantanamo? CHENEY:  I wouldn't make that -- I wouldn't make that case, John. I \nthink -- as I recall, the percentage that we had of the recidivists was \n12 percent.  And we released prisoners back basically to their home \ncountries, partly because the State Department was under enormous \npressure to do so, and there was an effort to try to return them.  The \nSaudis had a rehabilitation program for returned Saudis, and... KARL:  Did you oppose those releases? CHENEY:  I did.  I didn't think that releasing anybody was the right \nthing to do, unless you had evidence that, you know, there was a mistake \nof some kind or they'd been -- been before a commission and you'd \nreviewed their case and found that the case didn't stand up, and that \nwas usually the case.  They were put through a thorough scrub before \nthey were released. Obviously, some of them got through the filter.  But I think, out of \nthe ones that remain, those are the real hard core, and I think your \nrecidivist rate would be far higher than it was on those that have \nalready been released. It's a tough problem; I'll be the first to admit it.  But I think \nyou have to have a facility like Guantanamo to hold these individuals \nwho are members of Al Qaida, who've tried to kill Americans, and who -- \nwhen they're released, they'll go back out and try to kill Americans again. KARL:  I'd like to move to Iran.  Do you trust the Obama \nadministration to do what is necessary to keep Iran from getting nuclear \nweapons? CHENEY:  I remain to be persuaded. KARL:  Do you think that sanctions can work?  I mean, that's the \ntrack they've chosen. CHENEY:  Well, I think -- I hope sanctions work. KARL:  It's the same track you chose (ph). CHENEY:  We -- I certainly would hope sanctions would work, but I \nthink they're most likely to work if you keep the military option on the \ntable.  I don't think you want to eliminate the military -- the \npossibility of military action.  I think that's essential to give any \nkind of meaning at all to negotiations over sanctions. KARL:  How close did you come -- how close did the Bush \nadministration come to taking military action against Iran? CHENEY:  Well, I would -- some of that I can't talk about, \nobviously, still.  I'm sure it's still classified.  We clearly never \nmade the decision -- we never crossed over that line of saying, \"Now \nwe're going to mount a military operation to deal with the problem.\" The president was always hopeful -- and I think everybody else was, \ntoo -- that we could find a way to deal with it within having to resort \nto military force.  One of the problems that the Obama administration \ninherited was the Iranian problem, and it's a tough one. KARL:  David Sanger of the New York Times says that the Israelis \ncame to you -- came to the administration in the final months and asked \nfor certain things, bunker-buster bombs, air-to-air refueling \ncapability, overflight rights, and that basically the administration \ndithered, did not give the Israelis a response.  Was that a mistake? CHENEY:  I -- I can't get into it still.  I'm sure a lot of those \ndiscussions are still very sensitive. KARL:  Let me ask you:  Did you advocate a harder line, including in \nthe military area, in those -- in those final months? CHENEY:  Usually. KARL:  And with respect to Iran? CHENEY:  Well, I -- I made public statements to the effect that I \nfelt very strongly that we had to have the military option, that it had \nto be on the table, that it had to be a meaningful option, and that we \nmight well have to resort to military force in order to deal with the \nthreat that Iran represented.  The problem here being that a \nnuclear-armed Iran is a huge threat to that entire part of the world \nand, indeed, to the United States. KARL:  Was it -- was it a... CHENEY:  We never got to the point where the president had to make a \ndecision one way or the other. KARL:  Was that a mistake?  Was it a mistake to leave that nuclear \ncapability intact? CHENEY:  Well, we -- we did a lot, because we were very concerned \nabout nuclear capability in the hands of rogue states or potentially \nshared with terrorist organizations, and we were successful in taking \ndown, for example, Saddam Hussein, who had messed with nuclear weapons \ntwice previously, taking down the A.Q. Khan network, a black-market \noperation that was providing technology to the North Koreans, Iranians, \nand Libyans.  We successfully obtained all the Libyan materials for \ntheir nuclear program, so we got a lot done. We didn't get everything done.  We still -- when we finished, there \nstill was the ongoing Iranian problem and the ongoing North Korean \nproblem.  Both of them remain to be addressed. KARL:  I'd like to get your response to Sarah Palin's recent \ncomments on Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PALIN:  Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided really to \ncome out and do whatever he could to support Israel, which I would like \nhim to do, if he decided to toughen up and do all that he can to secure \nour nation and our allies, I think people would perhaps shift their \nthinking a little bit and decide, well, maybe he's tougher than we think \nhe -- than he is today. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  She's, of course, talking about President Obama, seemed to be \nimplying that this would be a good political move for him.  What's your \ntake? CHENEY:  I don't think a president can make a judgment like that on \nthe basis of politics.  The stakes are too high, the consequences too \nsignificant to be treating those as simple political calculations. When \nyou begin to talk about war, talk about crossing international borders, \nyou talk about committing American men and women to combat, that takes \nplace on a plane clear above any political consideration. KARL:  So... CHENEY:  So I'd be -- I'd be very cautious about treating that kind \nof issue on those kinds of conditions. KARL:  We're almost out of time.  We're going to get you very \nquickly on a few other subjects.  First of all, one more on Palin.  Is \nshe qualified to be president? CHENEY:  I haven't made a decision yet on who I'm going to support \nfor president the next time around.  Whoever it is, is going to have to \nprove themselves capable of being president of the United States.  And \nthose tests will -- will come during the course of campaigns, \nobviously.  I think -- well, I think all the prospective candidates out \nthere have got a lot of work to do if, in fact, they're going to \npersuade a majority of Americans that they're ready to take on the \nworld's toughest job. KARL:  OK, \"don't ask/don't tell\" -- you're a former defense \nsecretary -- should this policy be repealed? CHENEY:  Twenty years ago, the military were strong advocates of \n\"don't ask/don't tell,\" when I was secretary of defense.  I think things \nhave changed significantly since then.  I see that Don Mullen -- or Mike \nMullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has indicated his \nbelief that we ought to support a change in the policy. So I think -- my \nguess is the policy will be changed. KARL:  And do you think that's a good thing?  I mean, is it time to \nallow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military? CHENEY:  I think the society has moved on.  I think it's partly a \ngenerational question.  I say, I'm reluctant to second-guess the \nmilitary in this regard, because they're the ones that have got to make \nthe judgment about how these policies affect the military capability of \nour -- of our units, and that first requirement that you have to look at \nall the time is whether or not they're still capable of achieving their \nmission, and does the policy change, i.e., putting gays in the force, \naffect their ability to perform their mission? When the chiefs come forward and say, \"We think we can do it,\" then \nit strikes me that it's -- it's time to reconsider the policy. And I \nthink Admiral Mullen said that. KARL:  And, finally, I know that you have a reunion coming up later \nthis month with President Bush.  This'll be the first time you've seen \nhim since leaving office, face to face? CHENEY:  Pretty much, yes.  We talk on the telephone periodically, \nbut the first time I've seen him since January 20th. KARL:  What does he think of you being so outspoken in contrast to him? CHENEY:  Well, I don't think he's opposed to it, by any means. I'd \nbe inclined to let him speak for himself about it.  The reason I've been \noutspoken is because there were some things being said, especially after \nwe left office, about prosecuting CIA personnel that had carried out our \ncounterterrorism policy or disbarring lawyers in the Justice Department \nwho had -- had helped us put those policies together, and I was deeply \noffended by that, and I thought it was important that some senior person \nin the administration stand up and defend those people who'd done what \nwe asked them to do. And that's why I got started on it.  I'm the vice president now -- \nex-vice president.  I have the great freedom and luxury of speaking out, \nsaying what I -- what I want to say, what I believe.  And I have not \nbeen discouraged from doing so. KARL:  And that includes writing a book? CHENEY:  Writing a book, that's correct. KARL:  Can you give us -- before you go -- a quick nugget that's \ngoing to be in the book, give us the title, give us something going? CHENEY:  Have me back about a year from now, and I'll have a copy of \nthe book for you, John. KARL:  OK, it's deal. CHENEY:  All right. KARL:  Mr. Vice President, thanks a lot for joining us on \"This Week.\" CHENEY:  Good to see you.  I've enjoyed it. KARL:  The roundtable is next, George Will, Paul Gigot, Jane Mayer, \nand Peter Beinart.  And later, the Sunday funnies. Copyright © 2025 ABC News Internet Ventures"}
