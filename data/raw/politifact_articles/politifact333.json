Mitt Romney offered a pragmatic view of the tight Republican race for president Friday at a Denver car dealership, saying that some states are \"long shots\" for him while others are there for the taking. Colorado, he believed, fell into the latter category - which is why he made the stop in Denver on his way to Utah to attend funeral services for Gordon B. Hinckley. Hinckley, 97, was president of the Mormon church, of which Romney is a member. Romney, standing in the parking lot of Freeway Ford, stood with his sleeves rolled up, despite the rapidly dropping temperature, and offered a broad view of Super Tuesday's contest featuring 21 states, including Colorado, holding Republican caucuses or primaries. \"At this stage, I expect to keep on battling and get the nomination,\" he said. \"I'm not going to forecast anything but success.\" The campaign is targeting a series of states in the next few days that Romney could play well in. After Utah, where he enjoys strong support, the former Massachusetts governor will head to Minnesota. His campaign didn't rule out another trip to Colorado before Tuesday. The state has seen massive campaign activity this week as Super Tuesday nears, with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama drawing about 13,000 people at the University of Denver and former President Bill Clinton, stumping for his wife Sen. Hillary Clinton, bringing in about 4,500 at the same location. Dealership cites 'civic duty' Romney's event drew about 1,200 supporters, who were shoehorned into the car dealership showroom. It was a last-minute change of venue. The campaign had planned to host the rally at the Harley Davidson dealership in Thornton, but contacted Freeway Ford General Manager and Vice President Mike Peebles to see if they could have the event there after the motorcycle dealership's owner pulled the plug on the event. Peebles, who said that the business had not hosted a presidential candidate's visit before, agreed and soon had the place crawling with supporters, Secret Service and media - forcing salespeople from their cubicles and moving cars around to accommodate everyone. \"We're not endorsing him or anything,\" Peebles said. \"We just thought it would be a good thing to help out. Doing our civic duty, right?\" Romney spoke to the crowd for about 20 minutes, offering up his usual talking points about strengthening the economy, adding 100,000 troops to the military, and his experience as a businessman and governor. Romney, whose wealth has been estimated at $250 million, spent years as an investor and venture capitalist. One area where he didn't spend much time talking was on Western issues, including things such as natural resources. The economy was where he took his shot at his chief rival, Sen. John McCain - a name that elicited a chorus of boos. \"He has a number of things that are great strengths of his, but he happened to say the economy was not his strong suit,\" Romney said. \"Well, at a time like this in a country like this, I think it is important to have a president for whom the economy is his strong suit.\" Warnings about economy It was the only real slap at the McCain campaign, which did not return repeated calls for comment. Romney has been making his hay with the economy. He openly worried about the direction the nation is headed in and suggested that it could be headed for a dip in status amid emerging global economies. \"Unless we get ourselves on the right track, this country could become a second-tier nation,\" he said. It was a key part of Romney's theme. A poster behind him read \"Washington is broken.\" He cited his experience as a governor in a liberal state as proof that he could work with the opposition party and get things accomplished. Beauprez said that an ability to unify the country is needed and conceded that President Bush has had \"a bunker mentality\" that he believes Romney would not have if elected. Democrats offered a less rosy view. \"Mitt can't hide the fact that a vote for Romney is a vote for a third Bush term,\" said Damien LaVera, Democratic National Committee spokesman. Still, the crowd cheered at several points. Afterward, Romney waded through the crowd and signed T-shirts and posed for pictures. Recently, Romney has been casting himself as the choice of the conservative wing of the party by talking about illegal immigration and family values. The tactic has won some over, but he has not been able to secure an endorsement from Focus on the Family founder James Dobson. Dobson has said, speaking as a private citizen since the Colorado Springs-based group does not endorse candidates, that he would not support McCain.  Were in for a world of Hurt if Hillary or Mccain gets in office.....Please vote for Rommney!!!! thanks..... look at the expression on the face of the 2 kids in the audience; they're scared. Romney's just another empty suit trying to win a beauty contest. I'm scared too That's my baby.  She was scared of the noise.  When Romney spoke she stared at him in awe.  He is inspirational. How appropriate that Romney campaigns at a car dealership.  He comes across as the slick used car salesman anyway! We are in a real world of hurt if we elect a member of a cult as President. Romney was a venture capitalist -- a fancy name for someone who buys companies and then eliminates them -- putting Americans out of work and shipping the jobs overseas to Third World countries where people work for slave wages so Romney and his CEO buddies can make an extra buck. HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE OF THE TOP 4 THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION! The other 3 will open the gates. Hillary has even said that \"no woman is illegal\".  I am voting for Romney for that reason alone. AMERICAN THINKER: SOROS/MOVE-ON BACKS OBAMA In a resounding vote today, MoveOn.org Political Action's members nationwide voted to endorse Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination for President. The group, with 3.2 million members nationwide and over 1.7 million members in Super Tuesday states, will immediately begin to mobilize on behalf of Senator Obama. The vote favored Senator Obama to Senator Clinton by 70.4% to 29.6%. Let's hope its BO's KISS OF DEATH! To continue to think Romney is a member of a \"cult\" only shows ignorance. Not stupidity. I am not trying to be ugly. Ignorance of the Mormon faith is rampant in our society and much of the falsehoods about Mormons comes from other pulpits in the name of Christianity not knowing much about the tenets of the Mormon Christian doctrine. But putting all that aside. Mr. Romney has said, and I believe, he will not take direction from Salt Lake. He is a fine man of moral principle and values ala Jimmy Carter. Different politics, but similar moral conviction. I know Jimmy was/is a good man. Mr. Romney is a good man. PLUS HE IS QUALIFIED!! BigFoot, you got it. BO is much more qualified than Billary to run the country. We need Billary on the ticket so Mitt can defeat her more easily.  Go Billary!!  Go Mitt!! I have 2 wishes for Mitt. US Sen. Reid (Mormon), lied when he said he would remve FLDS from the welfare rolls. Will Mitt? Will Mitt come clean regarding his illegal religious NAM draft deferment? It doesn't pass the black smell test. Mitt's daddy was a Nixon cabinet member and his old-man engaged in high crimes and misdeameanors, because he and Mitt conspired to violate US Selective Service Board laws, which 67 years ago, outlawed religious draft deferments. When NAM broke-out, Mitt donned his beret, cut and ran for France, where he sipped vino and ate exotic chesses. This stench reeks of GHWB, who carved out a NAM sanctuary slot for his boy, in the racially segregated Texas Air National Guard (federal funded Augusta National). Violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Truman's executive order which desegregated all of our armed forces. Mitt and I are the same age, however, because I was born and raised behind The Cotton Curtain (SC/NC), when I was 18 years and 4 months old, I got a draft notice and I served in 3 deployments to Vietnam. While Mitt was on his flight to \"Gay-Paree\", for some unknown reason, Muhammad Ali was being sentenced to 5 years in federal prison for religious draft evasion. Ali's religious advisor, Elijah Muhammad had already served 3 years in federal prison for religious draft evasion and so had Elijah's son, Wallace D. Muhammad. Release Marion Jones and mike Vick, and give their cells to Mitt for 3 years. American Thinker: \"As guy who touts himself as a uniter and not a divider, Barack Obama sure doesn't vote that way in the United States Senate.  In fact, according to the National Journal's annual rankings, Obama is the most partisan, most liberal member of the Democratic caucus: Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., was the most liberal senator in 2007, according to National Journal's 27th annual vote ratings. The insurgent presidential candidate shifted further to the left last year in the run-up to the primaries, after ranking as the 16th- and 10th-most-liberal during his first two years in the Senate. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., the other front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, also shifted to the left last year. She ranked as the 16th-most-liberal senator in the 2007 ratings, a computer-assisted analysis that used 99 key Senate votes, selected by NJ reporters and editors, to place every senator on a liberal-to-conservative scale in each of three issue categories. In 2006, Clinton was the 32nd-most-liberal senator.\" $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ You want CHANGE?  Vote for either one of these two socialists and that's exactly what you'll get--a pocket full of nickles and dimes after they tax your butt off!   Not exactly the CHANGE that you had in mind; but still CHANGE! Mitt Romney will not reduce your taxes. Listen to Mitt Romney say he has no plans to reduce your taxes on this interview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lAFfLy05... One would Think the conservative \"Christian\" Right would be up in arms over someone whose Religion endorses PLURAL marriages? But in Mittens case it is swept under the rug. Much like that \"wide stance\" guy from Idaho. or the founder of the Mega Church who enjoyed Meth fueled gay sex... Mcain is a far better candidate that ol' Mitt. the Used Car salesman. then again when it comes to \"Social engineering\" leaving ones choices and Civil Rights alone... Democrats are Far more likely to restore the Constitution. and ensure Freedom of Religion.  While protecting us from Religious Extremists... Here, and in the Middle east.(What ever Brand that may be.) Hillary Clinton or Barak Obama *08 QUOTE FROM PRIOR POST--- \"One would Think the conservative \"Christian\" Right would be up in arms over someone whose Religion endorses PLURAL marriages?

It's not surprising how many liberals are only tolerant of people who think like they do. Seriously, plural marriages? That's your argument? Romney got 1200 people at his event.
