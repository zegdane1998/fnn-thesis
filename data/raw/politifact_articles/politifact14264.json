June 23, 2017 American News Share Tweet A huge new development in Washington, D.C. may be putting American security back on track. This is great news for American patriots everywhere, and we need to get behind it! According to various sources, FBI Director James Comey might soon be replaced by the Trump Administration. Even better, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is already being touted as Comey’s successor, via US Defense Watch. For those unaware of Gowdy’s many accomplishments, suffice it to say that the South Carolina conservative has been one of the more vocal critics of the Obama Administration for quite some time now. More recently, Representative Gowdy has been a voice of reason regarding the Democrat fixation on the idea of President Trump’s supposed connections to Vladimir Putin. He’s even gone on record defending California Republican Devin Nunes from Democrat attacks on his integrity and his ability to properly investigate whether Obama spied on Trump during the 2016 campaign, via Townhall. A long-time favorite of the Tea Party and other conservative groups, Gowdy is the type of man the Trump Administration needs to clean up the leftovers of the Obama Administration and its “Deep State” allies.
