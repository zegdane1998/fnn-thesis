Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves. NBC News reports : The two black men whose arrest at a Philadelphia Starbucks last month set off a wave of protests against the coffee giant for discrimination have reached a settlement with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday. They will each be paid $1. In addition, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, will release the city and employees of all claims in exchange for the creation of a $200,000 fund that, through the help of a nonprofit organization, will assist young entrepreneurs in Philadelphia. Robinson and Nelson will also serve on a committee to establish and award the grants, which will focus on starting a pilot curriculum for public high school students to attain the skills to become business owners. Good for Nelson, Robinson, and the city of Philadelphia in turning this into a positive moment. — Photo: Getty  A post shared by Xscape (@officialxscape) on Feb 7, 2018 at 8:28am PST A post shared by Xscape (@officialxscape) on Feb 7, 2018 at 7:59am PST A post shared by Xscape (@officialxscape) on Feb 7, 2018 at 8:26am PST  SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER Sign Up For “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show\" Newsletter!
