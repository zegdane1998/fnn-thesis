Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House\n\nEnergy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the\n\nfull committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: \"Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt\n\ntoday to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him\n\ntestify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. \"First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in\n\ndeveloping the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program\n\nstarting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and\n\nappreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit\n\nReduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need\n\nhealth care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a\n\nthriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we\n\nadopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of\n\nfinancial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors\n\nget the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to\n\nthe poor of their states. \"I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law\n\nthat have not recently received the public attention that they deserve.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered\n\nby the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a\n\nresult of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide\n\naccess to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will\n\nfacilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through\n\nthe Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true\n\nresults of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most\n\nneed our assistance. \"There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service\n\ndelivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have\n\nreceived the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the\n\nMedicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. \"This year the secretary and the administration also are required to\n\nadminister the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program\n\nsucceed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee\n\nthat I chair. \"Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they\n\nare not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it\n\nprovides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because\n\nit cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong\n\nwhen they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong\n\nwhen they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. \"Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others\n\ncan't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency\n\nand competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers.\n\nEven if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is\n\nwhy over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new\n\nbenefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans\n\nthat have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and\n\nenrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds\n\nlike a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which\n\nwe estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that\n\nappears to me to be a successful program. \"This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal\n\nis the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely\n\nwith yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved.\n\nWe will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on\n\nMarch 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I\n\nexpect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and\n\nwhat CMS is doing to fix them. \"Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of\n\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate\n\nmy deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's\n\nassistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long\n\noverdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act\n\nhas now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a\n\nresponsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to\n\nreauthorize these programs this year. \"I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare\n\nreimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to\n\npreserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how\n\nwe are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for\n\nour physician community to continue providing quality health care. \"Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the\n\nproposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with\n\ngreater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care\n\nproviders.
