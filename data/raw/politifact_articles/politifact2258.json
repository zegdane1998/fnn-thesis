Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter T. King (R-NY), Ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, issued a joint statement today after the U.S. State Department confirmed that Feisal Abdul Rauf, imam of the proposed Ground Zero Mosque in New York City, will travel to the Middle East through a taxpayer-funded program of the International Information Programs Bureau at the State Department.  Statement by Ros-Lehtinen and King: It is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East. Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is  a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas.  The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it. The State Departments selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administrations policy and funding priorities. Background:  In an interview televised just 19 days after the attacks against America on September 11, 2001, Abdul Rauf cast blame for them on the U.S.  He called the attacks a reaction against the U.S. Government politically I wouldnt say that the United States deserved what happened, but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened We have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world.  In fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA. Note:  On Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Abdul Rauf a distinguished Muslim cleric and noted that the State Department send[s]  people from Muslim communities here in this country around the world to help people overseas understand our society and the role of religion within our society. ###### Brad Goehner, (202) 226-8467 August 20, 2010 | Western Hemisphere August 19, 2010 | Western Hemisphere August 17, 2010 | International Organizations and Oversight August 13, 2010 | International Organizations and Oversight August 12, 2010 | Eastern Europe August 11, 2010 | Middle East and South Asia August 11, 2010 | Middle East and South Asia August 10, 2010 | Middle East and South Asia August 6, 2010 | Middle East and South Asia August 3, 2010 | Middle East and South Asia All content maintained by the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs | 2170 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515 | (202) 225-5021"}
