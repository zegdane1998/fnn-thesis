Washington,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 12 - As the one year anniversary of the Democrats’ trillion-dollar “ stimulus ” spending program approaches next Wednesday, it’s fitting to compare the results of the “stimulus” to the rhetoric that the President and Democratic leaders used to sell their spending plan - and see how their promises match up with reality. When Democrats rushed their massive 1,100 page, “ stimulus ” through Congress last year, they promised that unemployment would not rise above eight percent and that job creation would begin “ almost immediately ”.   But nearly one year later, more than three million more Americans have lost their jobs, the deficit is set to hit a record shattering $1.6 trillion, and Administration reports on how many jobs were “saved or created” have been “riddled with inaccuracies and contradictions,” noted USA Today . By the metrics the Democrats themselves set, the “ stimulus ” hasn’t worked – it’s chock-full of wasteful government spending that’s funneled money to Congressional districts that don’t exist and claims of jobs “saved or created” were so exaggerated that the Administration quietly abandoned the metric at the end of last year. Poll after poll confirms that an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the “stimulus” program.  In fact, a CBS/New York Times poll released yesterday found that “ just 6 percent of Americans think it has created jobs .”   Any wonder that a CNN survey reported that “3 of 4 Americans say much of stimulus money wasted.” So where is all the “stimulus” money going?  Here are just a few real-world examples: $75 million to bailout chicken farmers ( WSB , 2/11/10 ) $7 million to build a bridge in Thedford, Nebraska to help 168 residents avoid a 30 second wait at a local train crossing.  Not one full-time job will be created.  ( CNN , 1/28/10 ) $50,000 for new tennis courts in Bozeman, Montana ( Bozeman Daily Chronicle , 12/28/09 ) $100,000 for a martini bar and a Brazilian steak house in St. Joseph, Missouri. ( CBS , 12/9/09 ) $25,000 to provide free concerts in Sacramento, California ( The Sacramento Bee , 11/28/09 ) $123,000 for “security measures” to protect the Spirit of Boston party cruise ship from terrorist attacks.  Entertainment Cruises - the company which owns the Spirit of Boston - said: “We feel that we’re really a low threat for a terrorist incident.  But the stimulus was a nice perk.” ( The Boston Globe , 11/19/09 ) $1.5 million to fix a remote lighthouse on uninhabited Monomoy Island, off Cape Cod. ( The Boston Globe , 11/19/09 ) $95,000 for the University of Massachusetts at Boston to study pollen samples from the Viking era in Iceland. ( The Boston Globe , 11/19/09 ) “Stimulus” funds to study “circadian clocks of monarch butterflies,” “researching tusks of the Narwhal whale in the Arctic,” and “developing a colony of robotic bees.” “Stimulus” money also went to window blinds, photocopiers, a cafeteria dishwasher, taser guns, a riding lawnmower, and even a freezer for fish sperm. ( The Boston Globe , 11/19/09 ) The “stimulus” is offering “between $5,000 and $25,000” to “a contractor who can install a ‘bat compatible gate’ in Great Basin National Park, Nevada.” ( MSNBC , 11/11/09 ) “Nearly $1.3 million in federal economic recovery money is targeted for ‘archaeological surveys’ and maintenance work at two man-made lakes in eastern Connecticut.” ( New Haven Advocate , 9/1/09 ) “The feds are spending tens of millions of stimulus dollars to repair and build toilets across the nation, in an outflow of taxpayer funds that critics have branded ‘potty pork.’…In New Mexico alone, the feds are spending $2.8 million for toilets in national forests.” ( New York Post , 7/27/09 ) $400,000 to build a new runway for the Williamson Flying Club, a “private social club for local pilots” in upstate New York.  ( CBS Evening News , 7/13/09 ) The Purdue University Airport received $800,000 to help keep animals off the runway, “even though they've reported just one incident: a plane ran over a skunk in 1996.” ( CBS Evening News , 7/13/09 ) $15 million dollars went to “build a bigger, better airport” for the town of Ouizinkie, Alaska, population 165. ( CBS Evening News , 7/13/09 ) Thousands of dollars worth of signs touting the success of the “stimulus.” ( ABC News , 7/10/09 ) The State of Michigan made 40 road signs for promoting the fact that road projects were funded by the stimulus bill at a cost of $300 to $500 per sign, depending on the size of the sign. ( The Post-Standard , 7/05/09 ) In Syracuse, New York, $120,000 in federal stimulus money for Onondaga Lake cleanup will be used “to print a pamphlet about the lake cleanup.”  “The $120,000 will not rebuild infrastructure. It will not build anything. It won't even clean up a single drop of the polluted lake.” ( The Post-Standard , 5/31/09 ) Wisconsin has decided to use its “stimulus” money to repair 37 bridges that carry only about 500 cars each day, ignoring 1,256 “structurally deficient” bridges in need of immediate repair. ( Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , 3/29/09 ) And if that wasteful spending wasn’t bad enough, the Associated Press reported last month that: “A federal spending surge of more than $20 billion for roads and bridges in President Barack Obama’s first stimulus has had no effect on local unemployment rates...An Associated Press analysis of stimulus spending found that it didn’t matter if a lot of money was spent on highways or none at all: Local unemployment rates rose and fell regardless. And the stimulus spending only barely helped the beleaguered construction industry, the analysis showed.... “Even within the construction industry, which stood to benefit most from transportation money, the AP’s analysis found there was nearly no connection between stimulus money and the number of construction workers hired or fired since Congress passed the recovery program. The effect was so small, one economist compared it to trying to move the Empire State Building by pushing against it.” Americans understand the basic principle that you can’t spend your way into prosperity.  And many economists agree – in December, Leader Boehner released a list of 222 economists who support reining in federal spending, instead of pursuing even more of the same “stimulus,” to create jobs.   In fact, just weeks before the President signed the “stimulus” into law, “62% of U.S. voters want the plan to include more tax cuts and less government spending,” according to Rasmussen Reports . All Washington Democrats have to offer struggling families asking “ where are the jobs? ” is more spending, more debt, and more broken promises.  Republicans are offering better solutions: Create jobs by jumpstarting small business growth and restoring confidence in our economy; Make Washington do more with less with a responsible budget blueprint that sets strict caps to limit federal spending on annual basis; Lower health care premiums by up to 10 percent and consistently reduce federal spending over the next two decades; Clean up our environment and meet the nation’s energy needs by employing an “all of the above” strategy; Get the federal government out of the bailout business ; Protect responsible homeowners and revitalize America’s housing market; Help rebuild Americans’ savings , whether it’s for retirement, college, or buying a home; And bring much-needed transparency to the legislative process so we can accomplish all these goals with the open and honest government taxpayers deserve.
