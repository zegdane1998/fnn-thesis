MCCAIN AND OBAMA PARTICIPATE IN A PRESIDENTIAL \n\t\t\tCANDIDATES DEBATE, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY, HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK SPEAKERS: U.S. SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN (AZ) REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE U. S. SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (IL) DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE BOB SCHIEFFER, MODERATOR [*]\n\t\t\t     SCHIEFFER:  Good evening.  And welcome to the third and last\n\t\t\tpresidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on\n\t\t\tPresidential Debates.  I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News. The rules tonight are simple.  The subject is domestic policy.  I\n\t\t\twill divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments. I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment.  Each\n\t\t\tcandidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a\n\t\t\tdiscussion. I'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other.  If\n\t\t\tthey do not, I will. The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this\n\t\t\tmoment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain. (APPLAUSE) Gentlemen, welcome. By now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell\n\t\t\tthe people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard.  Let's\n\t\t\tget to it. Another very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know.  Both\n\t\t\tof you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis. Senator McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new\n\t\t\ttax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for\n\t\t\tstock losses, among other things. Senator Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle-\n\t\t\tincome and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new\n\t\t\tspending for public works projects to create jobs. I will ask both of you:  Why is your plan better than his? Senator McCain, you go first. MCCAIN:  Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you. And thanks to Hofstra. And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital\n\t\t\ttonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you. It's good to see you again, Senator Obama. Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry.  They're\n\t\t\thurting, and they're angry.  They're innocent victims of greed and\n\t\t\texcess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C.  And they're\n\t\t\tangry, and they have every reason to be angry. And they want this country to go in a new direction.  And there\n\t\t\tare elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't\n\t\t\trepeat. But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long-\n\t\t\tterm fixes. Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes. The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie\n\t\t\tMae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing\n\t\t\tmarket in America to collapse. I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in\n\t\t\thome ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not\n\t\t\tonly the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the\n\t\t\tAmerican dream, but that value will come up. Now, we have allocated $750 billion.  Let's take 300 of that\n\t\t\tbillion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with\n\t\t\tthose people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they\n\t\t\tcan afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home. Now, I know the criticism of this. MCCAIN:  Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?\n\t\t\tThat paid their mortgage payments?  It doesn't help that person in\n\t\t\ttheir home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.  And so\n\t\t\twe've got to reverse this.  We ought to put the homeowners first.  And\n\t\t\tI am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that\n\t\t\ttheir first priority. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  Senator Obama? OBAMA:  Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University\n\t\t\tand the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful\n\t\t\tto join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob. I think everybody understands at this point that we are\n\t\t\texperiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\t\t\tAnd the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is\n\t\t\tan important first step.  And I pushed for some core principles:\n\t\t\tmaking sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting\n\t\t\tmoney up.  Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through\n\t\t\tthis process. And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.\n\t\t\tBut what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.\n\t\t\tBecause the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this\n\t\t\tlatest crisis.  So I've proposed four specific things that I think can\n\t\t\thelp. Number one, let's focus on jobs.  I want to end the tax breaks\n\t\t\tfor companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit\n\t\t\tfor every company that's creating a job right here in America. Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a\n\t\t\ttax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than\n\t\t\t$200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without\n\t\t\tpenalty if they're experiencing a crisis. Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to\n\t\t\thelp homeowners.  That's why we included in the financial package a\n\t\t\tproposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate\n\t\t\ttheir mortgages. I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way\n\t\t\tSenator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks\n\t\t\tif we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot\n\t\t\tless.  And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.  And we've got to\n\t\t\tget the financial package working much quicker than it has been\n\t\t\tworking. Last point I want to make, though.  We've got some long-term\n\t\t\tchallenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.  We've got to\n\t\t\tfix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.  We've got to fix\n\t\t\tour health care system and we've got to invest in our education system\n\t\t\tfor every young person to be able to learn. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  Would you like to ask him a question? MCCAIN:  No.  I would like to mention that a couple days ago\n\t\t\tSenator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's\n\t\t\ta plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher. Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of\n\t\t\tthese years, worked 10, 12 hours a day.  And he wanted to buy the\n\t\t\tbusiness but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going\n\t\t\tto pay much higher taxes. You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going\n\t\t\tto increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to\n\t\t\temploy people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream. Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.  Joe, I want\n\t\t\tto tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked\n\t\t\tyour whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and\n\t\t\tI'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your\n\t\t\temployees. And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on\n\t\t\tsmall business income.  Fifty percent of small business income taxes\n\t\t\tare paid by small businesses.  That's 16 million jobs in America.  And\n\t\t\twhat you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is\n\t\t\thave their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American\n\t\t\tdream of owning their own business. SCHIEFFER:  Is that what you want to do? MCCAIN:  That's what Joe believes. OBAMA:  He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.  Let me\n\t\t\ttell you what I'm actually going to do.  I think tax policy is a major\n\t\t\tdifference between Senator McCain and myself.  And we both want to cut\n\t\t\ttaxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is\n\t\t\tto provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the\n\t\t\twealthiest corporations in America.  Exxon Mobil, and other oil\n\t\t\tcompanies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax\n\t\t\tbreaks. What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of\n\t\t\tworking Americans, 95 percent.  If you make more -- if you make less\n\t\t\tthan a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your\n\t\t\tincome tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.  Not\n\t\t\tone dime.  \n\t\t\t     And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there,\n\t\t\twill get a tax cut.  In fact, independent studies have looked at our\n\t\t\trespective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the\n\t\t\tamount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain\n\t\t\tdoes. OBAMA:  Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I\n\t\t\tessentially said to him was, \"Five years ago, when you were in a\n\t\t\tposition to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.\" And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the\n\t\t\tnurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who\n\t\t\tdoesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.  And that\n\t\t\trequires us to make some important choices. The last point I'll make about small businesses.  Not only do 98\n\t\t\tpercent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want\n\t\t\tto give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of\n\t\t\tthe economy.  They produce the most jobs. MCCAIN:  You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation\n\t\t\twith Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.  In other\n\t\t\twords, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and\n\t\t\tlet him spread the wealth around. I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.  You told\n\t\t\thim you wanted to spread the wealth around. The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare,\n\t\t\tlet's spread the wealth around.  I want small businesses -- and by the\n\t\t\tway, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an\n\t\t\tincrease in their taxes right now. Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?\n\t\t\tWhy would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have\n\t\t\tsuch a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the\n\t\t\tplumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him\n\t\t\tand spread the wealth around. I'm not going to... OBAMA:  OK.  Can I... MCCAIN:  We're not going to do that in my administration. OBAMA:  If I can answer the question.  Number one, I want to cut\n\t\t\ttaxes for 95 percent of Americans.  Now, it is true that my friend and\n\t\t\tsupporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little\n\t\t\tmore in taxes in order... MCCAIN:  We're talking about Joe the plumber.\n\t\t\t     OBAMA:  ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax\n\t\t\tcuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make\n\t\t\t$250,000. Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over\n\t\t\tthe last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so\n\t\t\tthat ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to\n\t\t\tfigure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save\n\t\t\tfor their kids' college education, they need a break. So, look, nobody likes taxes.  I would prefer that none of us had\n\t\t\tto pay taxes, including myself.  But ultimately, we've got to pay for\n\t\t\tthe core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got\n\t\t\tto do it. MCCAIN:  Nobody likes taxes.  Let's not raise anybody's taxes.\n\t\t\tOK? OBAMA:  Well, I don't mind paying a little more. MCCAIN:  The fact is that businesses in America today are paying\n\t\t\tthe second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.  Our tax rate\n\t\t\tfor business in America is 35 percent.  Ireland, it's 11 percent. Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and\n\t\t\twhere they can do best in business? We need to cut the business tax rate in America.  We need to\n\t\t\tencourage business. Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes.  We\n\t\t\tneed to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  Let's go to another topic.  It's related.\n\t\t\tSo if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that. This question goes to you first, Senator Obama. We found out yesterday that this year's deficit will reach an\n\t\t\tastounding record high $455 billion.  Some experts say it could go to\n\t\t\t$1 trillion next year. Both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the\n\t\t\tnonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers\n\t\t\ton both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals,\n\t\t\teven with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than\n\t\t\t$200 billion to the deficit. Aren't you both ignoring reality?  Won't some of the programs you\n\t\t\tare proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated? Give us some specifics on what you're going to cut back. Senator Obama? OBAMA:  Well, first of all, I think it's important for the\n\t\t\tAmerican public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if\n\t\t\tit's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's\n\t\t\tstructured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money\n\t\t\tback, and that's important to understand. But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and\n\t\t\twe're going to have to make some adjustments. Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net\n\t\t\tspending cut.  I haven't made a promise about... SCHIEFFER:  But you're going to have to cut some of these\n\t\t\tprograms, certainly. OBAMA:  Absolutely.  So let me get to that.  What I want to\n\t\t\temphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as-\n\t\t\tyou-go.  Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional\n\t\t\tcut so that it matches. OBAMA:  And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we\n\t\t\tspend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.  It\n\t\t\tdoesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any\n\t\t\tbetter.  It's not improving our health care system.  It's just a\n\t\t\tgiveaway. We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.\n\t\t\tAnd I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by\n\t\t\tpage, programs that don't work, we should cut.  Programs that we need,\n\t\t\twe should make them work better. Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference\n\t\t\tin terms of the need to invest in America and the American people.  I\n\t\t\tmentioned health care earlier. If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we\n\t\t\tare preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in\n\t\t\tthe future. If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the\n\t\t\tamount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia. If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to\n\t\t\tcollege, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st\n\t\t\tcentury. But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this\n\t\t\teconomic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of\n\t\t\tthis slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our\n\t\t\tprofligate ways. And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of\n\t\t\tresponsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and\n\t\t\tindividuals out there who may be living beyond their means. SCHIEFFER:  Time's up. Senator? MCCAIN:  Well, thank you, Bob.  I just want to get back to this\n\t\t\thome ownership.  During the Depression era, we had a thing called the\n\t\t\thome ownership loan corporation. And they went out and bought up these mortgages.  And people were\n\t\t\table to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes\n\t\t\twent up, and they actually made money.\n\t\t\t     And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not\n\t\t\ttoo long ago. So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there\n\t\t\twill be creation of wealth. SCHIEFFER:  But what... MCCAIN:  But -- OK.  All right. SCHIEFFER:  The question was, what are you going to cut? MCCAIN:  Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy\n\t\t\tindependence.  We have to have nuclear power.  We have to stop sending\n\t\t\t$700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.  It's\n\t\t\twind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which\n\t\t\tSenator Obama has opposed. And the point is that we become energy independent and we will\n\t\t\tcreate millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America. OK, what -- what would I cut?  I would have, first of all,\n\t\t\tacross-the-board spending freeze, OK?  Some people say that's a\n\t\t\thatchet.  That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK? Because we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase\n\t\t\t-- we've got to have a new direction for this country.  We have\n\t\t\tpresided over the largest increase in government since the Great\n\t\t\tSociety. Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10\n\t\t\ttrillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion\n\t\t\tdollars we owe China. I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.  I\n\t\t\tknow how to eliminate programs. SCHIEFFER:  Which ones? MCCAIN:  I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the\n\t\t\tmarketing assistance program.  Another one would be a number of\n\t\t\tsubsidies for ethanol. I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the\n\t\t\tmarket and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies. I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol\n\t\t\tfrom Brazil. I know how to save billions.  I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion\n\t\t\tby fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that\n\t\t\twas a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and\n\t\t\tpeople ended up in jail. But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly\n\t\t\tveto every earmark pork-barrel bill.  Senator Obama has asked for\n\t\t\tnearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects... SCHIEFFER:  Time's up. MCCAIN:  ... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a\n\t\t\tplanetarium in his hometown.  That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut\n\t\t\tout all the pork. SCHIEFFER:  Time's up. OBAMA:  Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about\n\t\t\tan across-the-board spending freeze.  It sounds good.  It's proposed\n\t\t\tperiodically.  It doesn't happen. And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet,\n\t\t\tand we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't\n\t\t\twork at all.  There are some programs that are underfunded.  And I\n\t\t\twant to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work. Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks.  That's one of\n\t\t\tthe centerpieces of his campaign. Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.\n\t\t\tThere's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of\n\t\t\tscrewy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be\n\t\t\teliminated.  But it's not going to solve the problem. Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit\n\t\t\tof history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward. When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and\n\t\t\tthe national debt was a little over $5 trillion.  It has doubled over\n\t\t\tthe last eight years. OBAMA:  And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a\n\t\t\ttrillion dollars. So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is\n\t\t\tpursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last\n\t\t\teight years is not going to bring down the deficit.  And, frankly,\n\t\t\tSenator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets. We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose\n\t\t\tas president. SCHIEFFER:  Do either of you think you can balance the budget in\n\t\t\tfour years?  You have said previously you thought you could, Senator\n\t\t\tMcCain. MCCAIN:  Sure I do.  And let me tell you... SCHIEFFER:  You can still do that? MCCAIN:  Yes.  Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.  If you\n\t\t\twanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years\n\t\t\tago.  I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this\n\t\t\tcountry. Senator Obama talks about voting for budgets.  He voted twice for\n\t\t\ta budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making\n\t\t\t$42,000 a year.  Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to\n\t\t\tthis budget.  It's completely out of control. The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across-\n\t\t\tthe-board spending freeze on New York City.  They're doing it all over\n\t\t\tAmerica because they have to.  Because they have to balance their\n\t\t\tbudgets.  I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will... SCHIEFFER:  In four years? MCCAIN:  ... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind\n\t\t\tof job creation of energy independence. Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I\n\t\t\tunderstand that, and they want a new direction.  I can bring them in\n\t\t\tthat direction by eliminating spending. Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for.  He voted for\n\t\t\tthe last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than\n\t\t\tthe budget that the Bush administration proposed.  \n\t\t\t     He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil\n\t\t\tcompanies that I opposed.  So the fact is, let's look at our records,\n\t\t\tSenator Obama.  Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers\n\t\t\tUnion and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog\n\t\t\torganizations. I have fought against spending.  I have fought against special\n\t\t\tinterests.  I have fought for reform.  You have to tell me one time\n\t\t\twhen you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single\n\t\t\tmajor issue. SCHIEFFER:  Barack. OBAMA:  Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so\n\t\t\tlet me try to address it.  First of all, in terms of standing up to\n\t\t\tthe leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the\n\t\t\tSenate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with\n\t\t\ttrial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.  I\n\t\t\tsupport... MCCAIN:  An overwhelming vote. OBAMA:  I support charter schools and pay for performance for\n\t\t\tteachers.  Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.  I support\n\t\t\tclean coal technology.  Doesn't make me popular with\n\t\t\tenvironmentalists.  So I've got a history of reaching across the\n\t\t\taisle. Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the\n\t\t\tnotion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a\n\t\t\tyear has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that\n\t\t\tSenator McCain keeps on making. Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often\n\t\t\twhen it comes to accusations about me.  So the fact of the matter is\n\t\t\tthat if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's\n\t\t\tpolicies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the\n\t\t\tAmerican people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending\n\t\t\tpriorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush. Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on\n\t\t\tsome key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous\n\t\t\tcredit for that.  But when it comes to economic policies, essentially\n\t\t\twhat you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.  And it\n\t\t\thasn't worked. And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.  We\n\t\t\tneed to move in a new direction. SCHIEFFER:  All right... MCCAIN:  Let me just say, Bob. SCHIEFFER:  OK.  About 30 seconds. MCCAIN:  OK.  But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the\n\t\t\tBush administration.  I have disagreed with leaders of my own party.\n\t\t\tI've got the scars to prove it. Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate\n\t\t\tfor the first time.  Whether it be opposition to spending and\n\t\t\tearmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the\n\t\t\tconduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.  Whether it be\n\t\t\ton fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription\n\t\t\tdrugs, importation.  Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill\n\t\t\tof rights.  Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission. I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor\n\t\t\tof the United States Senate. SCHIEFFER:  All right. MCCAIN:  Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the\n\t\t\tleadership of your party isn't very convincing. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  We're going to move to another question\n\t\t\tand the topic is leadership in this campaign.  Both of you pledged to\n\t\t\ttake the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty. SCHIEFFER:  Senator Obama, your campaign has used words like\n\t\t\t\"erratic,\" \"out of touch,\" \"lie,\" \"angry,\" \"losing his bearings\" to\n\t\t\tdescribe Senator McCain. Senator McCain, your commercials have included words like\n\t\t\t\"disrespectful,\" \"dangerous,\" \"dishonorable,\" \"he lied.\"  Your running\n\t\t\tmate said he \"palled around with terrorists.\" Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to\n\t\t\teach other's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns\n\t\t\thave said about each other? And, Senator McCain, you're first. MCCAIN:  Well, this has been a tough campaign.  It's been a very\n\t\t\ttough campaign.  And I know from my experience in many campaigns that,\n\t\t\tif Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit\n\t\t\tdown, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people,\n\t\t\twe could have done at least 10 of them by now. When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, \"Any place, any\n\t\t\ttime,\" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before\n\t\t\tthe intervention of the tragedy at Dallas.  So I think the tone of\n\t\t\tthis campaign could have been very different. And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.  And I regret some of\n\t\t\tthe negative aspects of both campaigns.  But the fact is that it has\n\t\t\ttaken many turns which I think are unacceptable. One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and\n\t\t\trespect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an\n\t\t\tAmerican hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow\n\t\t\tassociated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation,\n\t\t\tdeaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.  That, to me,\n\t\t\twas so hurtful. And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.  Every\n\t\t\ttime there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no\n\t\t\tmatter where they are, I have repudiated them.  I hope that Senator\n\t\t\tObama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John\n\t\t\tLewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate. So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign.  This is\n\t\t\ta tough campaign.  And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has\n\t\t\tspent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in\n\t\t\thistory.  And I can prove it.  \n\t\t\t     And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of\n\t\t\tpaper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I\n\t\t\tdid -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't\n\t\t\tkeep your word. And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator\n\t\t\tClinton and said, \"I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain\n\t\t\tabout public financing before I make a decision,\" you didn't tell the\n\t\t\tAmerican people the truth because you didn't. And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.  Now we have\n\t\t\tthe highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since\n\t\t\tWatergate. SCHIEFFER:  Time's up.  All right. OBAMA:  Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential\n\t\t\tcampaigns to be tough.  I think that, if you look at the record and\n\t\t\tthe impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a\n\t\t\tpoll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that\n\t\t\tSenator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of\n\t\t\tmine. And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have\n\t\t\tbeen negative. MCCAIN:  It's not true. OBAMA:  It absolutely is true.  And, now, I think the American\n\t\t\tpeople are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of\n\t\t\tthe campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply. And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like\n\t\t\twe're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax\n\t\t\tpolicy.  That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of. The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall\n\t\t\tmeetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not\n\t\t\tjust from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other\n\t\t\torganizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't\n\t\t\tmind being attacked for the next three weeks. What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years\n\t\t\tof failed economic policies.  And what they deserve over the next four\n\t\t\tweeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them:  the\n\t\t\teconomic crisis. Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we\n\t\t\tkeep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to\n\t\t\tchange the subject. And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking\n\t\t\tabout the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to\n\t\t\ttalking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can\n\t\t\tsend their kids to college.  \n\t\t\t     And that is something that I would welcome.  But it requires, I\n\t\t\tthink, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over\n\t\t\tthe last several years, is not solving the big problems here in\n\t\t\tAmerica. MCCAIN:  Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I\n\t\t\twatched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. OBAMA:  Congratulations. MCCAIN:  Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my\n\t\t\thealth care plan.  And any objective observer has said it's not true.\n\t\t\tYou're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding\n\t\t\tfor stem cell research.  I don't. You're running ads that misportray completely my position on\n\t\t\timmigration.  So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending\n\t\t\tunprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics,\n\t\t\tgoing back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads\n\t\t\ton me. And of course, I've been talking about the economy.  Of course,\n\t\t\tI've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not\n\t\t\tgoing to spread his wealth around.  I'm going to let him keep his\n\t\t\twealth.  And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to\n\t\t\trestore this economy and restore jobs in America. That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll\n\t\t\tcontinue to be all about. But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman... OBAMA:  I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis,\n\t\t\twho is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my\n\t\t\tcampaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what\n\t\t\the was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was\n\t\t\tholding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting,\n\t\t\twhen my name came up, things like \"terrorist\" and \"kill him,\" and that\n\t\t\tyou're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say \"Hold on a\n\t\t\tsecond, that's kind of out of line.\" And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be\n\t\t\tcareful about how we deal with our supporters. Now... MCCAIN:  You've got to read what he said... (CROSSTALK) OBAMA:  Let -- let -- let...\n\t\t\t     MCCAIN:  You've got to read what he said. OBAMA:  Let me -- let me complete... SCHIEFFER:  Go ahead. OBAMA:  ... my response.  I do think that he inappropriately drew\n\t\t\ta comparison between what was happening there and what had happened\n\t\t\tduring the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a\n\t\t\tstatement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate. And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar\n\t\t\tstatement, saying that he had probably gone over the line. The important point here is, though, the American people have\n\t\t\tbecome so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit-\n\t\t\tfor-tat and back-and-forth.  And what they want is the ability to just\n\t\t\tfocus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's\n\t\t\twhat I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign. MCCAIN:  I cannot... OBAMA:  We can have serious differences about our health care\n\t\t\tpolicy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health\n\t\t\tcare policy, but we... MCCAIN:  We do and I hope... OBAMA:  ... talking about it this evening. MCCAIN:  Sure. OBAMA:  But when people suggest that I pal around with\n\t\t\tterrorists, then we're not talking about issues.  What we're talking\n\t\t\tabout... MCCAIN:  Well, let me just say I would... SCHIEFFER:  (inaudible) MCCAIN:  Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people\n\t\t\tthat come to our rallies.  Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000,\n\t\t\t15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.  You\n\t\t\tknow that.  And I've -- and we've always said that that's not\n\t\t\tappropriate. But to somehow say that group of young women who said \"Military\n\t\t\twives for McCain\" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you,\n\t\t\tbut anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say\n\t\t\t\"World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,\" I'm not going to stand for\n\t\t\tpeople saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but\n\t\t\tthe most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation\n\t\t\tand they're great citizens. And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because\n\t\t\tsomeone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that\n\t\t\thave been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy\n\t\t\tabout either. In fact, some T-shirts that are very... OBAMA:  John, I... MCCAIN:  ... unacceptable.  So the point is -- the point is that\n\t\t\tI have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether\n\t\t\tthey've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do\n\t\t\tthat. But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind\n\t\t\tof things that have been going on.  I haven't. OBAMA:  Well, look, Bob, as I said... SCHIEFFER:  I mean, do you take issue with that? OBAMA:  You know, here's what I would say.  I mean, we can have a\n\t\t\tdebate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns.  I\n\t\t\tsuspect we won't agree here tonight. What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve\n\t\t\tthe key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars,\n\t\t\tthe worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if\n\t\t\twe're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last\n\t\t\teight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats,\n\t\t\tindependents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work\n\t\t\ttogether. OBAMA:  And what is important is making sure that we disagree\n\t\t\twithout being disagreeable.  And it means that we can have tough,\n\t\t\tvigorous debates around issues.  What we can't do, I think, is try to\n\t\t\tcharacterize each other as bad people.  And that has been a culture in\n\t\t\tWashington that has been taking place for too long.  And I think... MCCAIN:  Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question. SCHIEFFER:  Short answer, yes, short answer. MCCAIN:  Yes, real quick.  Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old\n\t\t\twashed-up terrorist.  But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with\n\t\t\tyou, we need to know the full extent of that relationship. We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship\n\t\t\twith ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the\n\t\t\tgreatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the\n\t\t\tfabric of democracy.  The same front outfit organization that your\n\t\t\tcampaign gave $832,000 for \"lighting and site selection.\" So all of\n\t\t\tthese things need to be examined, of course. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  I'm going to let you respond and we'll\n\t\t\textend this for a moment. OBAMA:  Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll\n\t\t\trespond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has\n\t\t\tmade and that have gotten a lot of attention. In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's\n\t\t\tcampaign over the last two or three weeks.  This has been their\n\t\t\tprimary focus.  So let's get the record straight.  Bill Ayers is a\n\t\t\tprofessor of education in Chicago. Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable\n\t\t\tacts with a radical domestic group.  I have roundly condemned those\n\t\t\tacts.  Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board\n\t\t\tthat was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close\n\t\t\tfriends, Mr. Annenberg. Other members on that board were the presidents of the University\n\t\t\tof Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to\n\t\t\tbe a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican-\n\t\t\tleaning newspaper. Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.  He has never been\n\t\t\tinvolved in this campaign.  And he will not advise me in the White\n\t\t\tHouse.  So that's Mr. Ayers. Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.\n\t\t\tApparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and\n\t\t\tregister folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there\n\t\t\tdidn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. It had nothing to do with us.  We were not involved.  The only\n\t\t\tinvolvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the\n\t\t\tU.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law\n\t\t\tthat helped people get registered at DMVs. Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these\n\t\t\tfacts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has\n\t\t\tcontinually made is that somehow my associations are troubling. Let me tell you who I associate with.  On economic policy, I\n\t\t\tassociate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.\n\t\t\tIf I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate\n\t\t\tmyself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the\n\t\t\tRepublican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\n\t\t\tor General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO. Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped\n\t\t\tmy ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.  And I\n\t\t\tthink the fact that this has become such an important part of your\n\t\t\tcampaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says\n\t\t\tabout me. MCCAIN:  Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods\n\t\t\tFoundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.\n\t\t\tSo -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living\n\t\t\troom. OBAMA:  That's absolutely not true. MCCAIN:  And the facts are facts and records are records. OBAMA:  And that's not the facts. MCCAIN:  And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator\n\t\t\tObama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished\n\t\t\the had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.  It's\n\t\t\tthe fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about\n\t\t\tSenator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American\n\t\t\tpeople will make a judgment. And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track,\n\t\t\tabout creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.  And that's\n\t\t\twhat my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way\n\t\t\tSenator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.  And that's\n\t\t\treally what this campaign is going to be about. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  Let's go to the next topic and you -- we\n\t\t\tmay want to get back into some of this during this next discussion.  I\n\t\t\twant to ask both of you about the people that you're going to bring\n\t\t\tinto the government.  \n\t\t\t     And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running\n\t\t\tmates. SCHIEFFER:  So I'll begin by asking both of you this question,\n\t\t\tand I'll ask you to answer first, Senator Obama.  Why would the\n\t\t\tcountry be better off if your running mate became president rather\n\t\t\tthan his running mate? OBAMA:  Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public\n\t\t\tservants that has served in this country.  It's not just that he has\n\t\t\tsome of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.  And Democrats\n\t\t\tand Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there. But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where\n\t\t\the came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working\n\t\t\tfamilies, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job\n\t\t\tand go through a downward spiral economically. And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his\n\t\t\tcareer is to fight for the little guy.  That's what he's done when it\n\t\t\tcomes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg\n\t\t\tup. That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the\n\t\t\tlandmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.  Joe has\n\t\t\talways made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families,\n\t\t\tand I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country\n\t\t\tneeds to go. Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree\n\t\t\tthat what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that\n\t\t\twe're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the\n\t\t\twealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give\n\t\t\tthem to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we\n\t\t\tfinally get serious about energy independence, something that has been\n\t\t\tlanguishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids\n\t\t\tget a great education and can afford to go to college. So, on the key issues that are of importance to American\n\t\t\tfamilies, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he\n\t\t\twill make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something\n\t\t\thappened to me. SCHIEFFER:  Senator? MCCAIN:  Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.  They\n\t\t\tknow that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all\n\t\t\tover America.  \n\t\t\t     She's a reformer.  She is -- she took on a governor who was a\n\t\t\tmember of her own party when she ran for governor.  When she was the\n\t\t\thead of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption,\n\t\t\tshe resigned and said, \"This can't go on.\" She's given money back to the taxpayers.  She's cut the size of\n\t\t\tgovernment.  She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them\n\t\t\tdown, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve\n\t\t\tthe energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48. She's a reformer through and through.  And it's time we had that\n\t\t\tbresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our\n\t\t\tnation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism\n\t\t\tthat's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all\n\t\t\tthese years. She'll be my partner.  She understands reform.  And, by the way,\n\t\t\tshe also understands special-needs families.  She understands that\n\t\t\tautism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it,\n\t\t\tand we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give\n\t\t\tthem the help they need as they raise these very special needs\n\t\t\tchildren. She understands that better than almost any American that I know.\n\t\t\tI'm proud of her. And she has ignited our party and people all over America that\n\t\t\thave never been involved in the political process.  And I can't tell\n\t\t\thow proud I am of her and her family. Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too. SCHIEFFER:  Do you think she's qualified to be president? OBAMA:  You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the\n\t\t\tAmerican people.  I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician\n\t\t\twho has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party. And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf\n\t\t\tof special needs.  I agree with that, John. I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other\n\t\t\tspecial needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to\n\t\t\tget serious in terms of research.  That is something that every family\n\t\t\tthat advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about. And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not\n\t\t\tgoing to be able to do it.  That's an example of, I think, the kind of\n\t\t\tuse of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some\n\t\t\tof those programs. SCHIEFFER:  Do you think Senator Biden is qualified? MCCAIN:  I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.\n\t\t\tBut I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and\n\t\t\tnational security issues, which is supposed to be his strength. He voted against the first Gulf War.  He voted against it and,\n\t\t\tobviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've\n\t\t\tthreatened the Middle Eastern world supply. In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into\n\t\t\tthree countries.  We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but\n\t\t\twe're seeing them.  We're now about to have an agreement for status of\n\t\t\tforces in Iraq coming up. There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I open\n\t\t\tand honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been\n\t\t\twrong on a number of the major ones. But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator\n\t\t\tObama says, \"We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the\n\t\t\tanswer\" -- why do we always have to spend more? Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these\n\t\t\tagencies of government?  Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought\n\t\t\tand proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise\n\t\t\tpeople's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and\n\t\t\theartache for the American families. SCHIEFFER:  Let's go to -- let's go to a new topic.  We're\n\t\t\trunning a little behind. Let's talk about energy and climate control.  Every president\n\t\t\tsince Nixon has said what both of you... MCCAIN:  Climate change. SCHIEFFER:  Climate change, yes -- has said what both of you have\n\t\t\tsaid, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. When Nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our\n\t\t\tforeign oil.  Now, we're importing more than 60 percent. Would each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much\n\t\t\tyou believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first\n\t\t\tterm? And I believe the first question goes to you, Senator McCain.\n\t\t\t     MCCAIN:  I think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate\n\t\t\tour dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil.  Canadian oil\n\t\t\tis fine. By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally\n\t\t\trenegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians\n\t\t\tsaid, \"Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.\" You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate\n\t\t\tagreements with them. We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new\n\t\t\tnuclear plants, power plants, right away.  We can store and we can\n\t\t\treprocess. Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme\n\t\t\tenvironmentalists do, it has to be safe. Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with\n\t\t\tnuclear power plants on them.  We can store and reprocess spent\n\t\t\tnuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem. So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar,\n\t\t\tnatural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal\n\t\t\ttechnology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America\n\t\t\tthat's hurting rather badly. So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we\n\t\t\tput our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in\n\t\t\tthe world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our\n\t\t\tindependence. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  Can we reduce our dependence on foreign\n\t\t\toil and by how much in the first term, in four years? OBAMA:  I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence\n\t\t\tso that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or\n\t\t\tVenezuela.  I think that's about a realistic timeframe. And this is the most important issue that our future economy is\n\t\t\tgoing to face.  Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.\n\t\t\tBut nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion\n\t\t\tor more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.  It's mortgaging\n\t\t\tour children's future. Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one\n\t\t\tof my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do. Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that\n\t\t\tmeans, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres\n\t\t\tthat they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or\n\t\t\tlose them. And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and\n\t\t\timplement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.  But\n\t\t\tunderstand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil\n\t\t\treserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we\n\t\t\tcan't drill our way out of the problem. That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind,\n\t\t\tbiodiesel, geothermal.  These have been priorities of mine since I got\n\t\t\tto the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high\n\t\t\tfuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea,\n\t\t\tbut built here in the United States of America. We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so\n\t\t\tfar behind is something that we have to work on. OBAMA:  Now I just want to make one last point because Senator\n\t\t\tMcCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears\n\t\t\ton this issue.  I believe in free trade.  But I also believe that for\n\t\t\tfar too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration\n\t\t\twith the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any\n\t\t\ttrade agreement is a good trade agreement.  And NAFTA doesn't have --\n\t\t\tdid not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental\n\t\t\tagreements. And what I said was we should include those and make them\n\t\t\tenforceable.  In the same way that we should enforce rules against\n\t\t\tChina manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and\n\t\t\ttheir exports to us cheaper. And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up\n\t\t\tright now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars\n\t\t\tinto the United States.  That's all good.  We can only get 4,000 to\n\t\t\t5,000 into South Korea.  That is not free trade.  We've got to have a\n\t\t\tpresident who is going to be advocating on behalf of American\n\t\t\tbusinesses and American workers and I make no apology for that. SCHIEFFER:  Senator? MCCAIN:  Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's\n\t\t\teloquence.  And you really have to pay attention to words.  He said,\n\t\t\twe will look at offshore drilling.  Did you get that?  Look at.  We\n\t\t\tcan offshore drill now.  We've got to do it now.  We will reduce the\n\t\t\tcost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a\n\t\t\tsupply of our own.  It's doable.  The technology is there and we have\n\t\t\tto drill now. Now, on the subject of free trade agreements.  I am a free\n\t\t\ttrader.  And I need -- we need to have education and training programs\n\t\t\tfor displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges. But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement\n\t\t\tthat Senator Obama opposes.  Right now, because of previous\n\t\t\tagreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products\n\t\t\tthat we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer\n\t\t\tof our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our\n\t\t\tbusinesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there. Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come\n\t\t\tinto our country for free.  So Senator Obama, who has never traveled\n\t\t\tsouth of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.  The\n\t\t\tsame country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our\n\t\t\tcountry that's killing young Americans. And also the country that just freed three Americans that will\n\t\t\thelp us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our\n\t\t\tgoods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay\n\t\t\tthe billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've\n\t\t\talready paid. Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.  But\n\t\t\tmaybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you\n\t\t\tcould understand it a lot better. OBAMA:  Let me respond.  Actually, I understand it pretty well.\n\t\t\tThe history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been\n\t\t\ttargeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have\n\t\t\tnot been prosecutions. And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade\n\t\t\tagreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we\n\t\t\thave to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence\n\t\t\tisn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to\n\t\t\torganize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the\n\t\t\tPeruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement. But I think that the important point is we've got to have a\n\t\t\tpresident who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going\n\t\t\tto enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other\n\t\t\tcountries. And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.  When\n\t\t\tI talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered\n\t\t\tright now.  They were already having a tough time because of high gas\n\t\t\tprices.  And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are\n\t\t\tclosing and people can't get car loans. That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees\n\t\t\tto the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to\n\t\t\tstart producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting\n\t\t\tthat done.  It's going to be one of my highest priorities because\n\t\t\ttransportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy\n\t\t\tconsumption. If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not\n\t\t\tonly of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all\n\t\t\tacross America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of\n\t\t\tthese plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make\n\t\t\twind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches\n\t\t\tthat should be the driver of our economy for the next century. MCCAIN:  Well, let me just said that that this is -- he --\n\t\t\tSenator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally\n\t\t\tin the region but wants to sit down across the table without\n\t\t\tprecondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping\n\t\t\tFARC, the terrorist organization. Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you\n\t\t\tthe benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of\n\t\t\tAmerican dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses\n\t\t\tin the United States, opening up those markets. So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama\n\t\t\twants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.  And the last\n\t\t\tpresident of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and\n\t\t\twe went from a deep recession into a depression. We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm\n\t\t\tpresident of the United States. SCHIEFFER:  All right, let's go to a new topic, health care.\n\t\t\tGiven the current economic situation, would either of you now favor\n\t\t\tcontrolling health care costs over expanding health care coverage?\n\t\t\tThe question is first to Senator Obama. OBAMA:  We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan\n\t\t\tdoes. Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will\n\t\t\tbreak your heart over and over again.  Just yesterday, I was in Toledo\n\t\t\tshaking some hands in a line.  Two women, both of them probably in\n\t\t\ttheir mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.\n\t\t\tNeither of them have health insurance. And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage,\n\t\t\tbecause, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they\n\t\t\tcould go bankrupt. So here's what my plan does.  If you have health insurance, then\n\t\t\tyou don't have to do anything.  If you've got health insurance through\n\t\t\tyour employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of\n\t\t\tdoctor, keep your plan. The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that\n\t\t\tthose cost savings are passed onto you.  And we estimate we can cut\n\t\t\tthe average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.  \n\t\t\t     If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do\n\t\t\tis to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal\n\t\t\tpool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which\n\t\t\twill give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs,\n\t\t\tbecause so many people are part of this insured group. We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't\n\t\t\tdiscriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.  We'll negotiate\n\t\t\twith the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate\n\t\t\tbureaucracy and make the system more efficient. And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses,\n\t\t\tlike diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be\n\t\t\tprevented.  We've got to put more money into preventive care. This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long\n\t\t\tterm this is the only way that not only are we going to make families\n\t\t\thealthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget,\n\t\t\tbecause we can't afford these escalating costs. SCHIEFFER:  All right. Senator McCain? MCCAIN:  Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.\n\t\t\tThey're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.  Forty-seven\n\t\t\tmillion Americans are without health insurance in America today. And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care\n\t\t\tthat are inflicting such pain on working families and people across\n\t\t\tthis country.  And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things. We need to put health care records online.  The V.A. does that.\n\t\t\tThat will -- that will reduce costs.  We need to have more community\n\t\t\thealth centers.  We need to have walk-in clinics. The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most\n\t\t\talarming statistics that there is.  We should have physical fitness\n\t\t\tprograms and nutrition programs in schools.  Every parent should know\n\t\t\twhat's going on there. We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward\n\t\t\temployees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness. But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax\n\t\t\tcredit.  Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you\n\t\t\twish. Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.  Now, Joe,\n\t\t\tSenator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able --\n\t\t\tand your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains\n\t\t\ttax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my\n\t\t\tfriend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't\n\t\t\tget -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's\n\t\t\tgoing to fine you. MCCAIN:  Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what\n\t\t\tthat fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants\n\t\t\tto pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's\n\t\t\teconomy. Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take\n\t\t\tover the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a\n\t\t\tsingle payer system. If you like that, you'll love Canada and England.  So the point\n\t\t\tis... SCHIEFFER:  So that's your objective? OBAMA:  It is not and I didn't describe it... MCCAIN:  No, you stated it. OBAMA:  I just... MCCAIN:  Excuse me. OBAMA:  I just described what my plan is.  And I'm happy to talk\n\t\t\tto you, Joe, too, if you're out there.  Here's your fine -- zero.  You\n\t\t\twon't pay a fine, because... MCCAIN:  Zero? OBAMA:  Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll\n\t\t\trepeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large\n\t\t\tbusinesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees,\n\t\t\tbut are not doing it. I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.  But\n\t\t\tlarge businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.  Either they\n\t\t\tprovide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to. Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either\n\t\t\tthe Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the\n\t\t\temergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in\n\t\t\ttheir premiums. The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher\n\t\t\tpremiums because of the uninsured. So here's what we do.  We exempt small businesses.  In fact,\n\t\t\twhat, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and\n\t\t\tyou want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent\n\t\t\tcredit so that you will actually be able to afford it. If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a\n\t\t\tgroup plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just\n\t\t\tdescribed. Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.  He\n\t\t\tsays he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.  That sounds\n\t\t\tpretty good.  And you can go out and buy your own insurance. Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may\n\t\t\tfind yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.\n\t\t\tThis is because younger people might be able to get health insurance\n\t\t\tfor $5,000, young and healthy folks. Older folks, let's healthy folks, what's going to end up\n\t\t\thappening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your\n\t\t\temployer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it. And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator\n\t\t\tMcCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care\n\t\t\tbenefits that you have from your employer. And this is your plan, John.  For the first time in history, you\n\t\t\twill be taxing people's health care benefits. By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.  So if you've\n\t\t\tgot $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you. Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right\n\t\t\tnow, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and,\n\t\t\tunder Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and\n\t\t\tyou would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking\n\t\t\tand excluding people from coverage. That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a\n\t\t\tfundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach\n\t\t\thealth care. SCHIEFFER:  What about that? MCCAIN:  Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe\n\t\t\twanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12\n\t\t\thours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread\n\t\t\tthe wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you\n\t\t\tdecide what to do with it. Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall\n\t\t\tinto the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide\n\t\t\thealth insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you\n\t\t\tthink is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the\n\t\t\tkind that he mandates for you. That's big government at its best.\n\t\t\t     Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money\n\t\t\tunder my plan because they will receive not only their present\n\t\t\tbenefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add\n\t\t\t$5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated\n\t\t\tCadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and\n\t\t\ttransplants and all of those kinds of things. And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across\n\t\t\tAmerica.  The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America\n\t\t\ttoday is $5,800.  I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them\n\t\t\twherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability. This will give them availability.  This will give them a chance\n\t\t\tto choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government\n\t\t\tdecide that for them. This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our\n\t\t\tphilosophies.  If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator --\n\t\t\tgovernment wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job. Senator Obama wants government to do the job.  I want, Joe, you\n\t\t\tto do the job. MCCAIN:  I want to leave money in your pocket.  I want you to be\n\t\t\table to choose the health care for you and your family.  That's what\n\t\t\tI'm all about.  And we've got too much government and too much\n\t\t\tspending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by\n\t\t\t40 percent in the last eight years. We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama,\n\t\t\twith the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.\n\t\t\tHave you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  A short response. OBAMA:  Very briefly.  You all just heard my plan.  If you've got\n\t\t\tan employer-based health care plan, you keep it.  Now, under Senator\n\t\t\tMcCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their\n\t\t\temployer-based health care. That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer\n\t\t\tprovide you health care.  And don't take my word for it.  The U.S.\n\t\t\tChamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of\n\t\t\tDemocrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the\n\t\t\temployer-based health care system. All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower\n\t\t\tyour costs.  That includes you, Joe. SCHIEFFER:  All right.  Let's stop there and go to another\n\t\t\tquestion.  And this one goes to Senator McCain.  Senator McCain, you\n\t\t\tbelieve Roe v. Wade should be overturned.  Senator Obama, you believe\n\t\t\tit shouldn't. Could either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court\n\t\t\twho disagrees with you on this issue?  Senator McCain? MCCAIN:  I would never and have never in all the years I've been\n\t\t\tthere imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.  That's not\n\t\t\tappropriate to do. SCHIEFFER:  But you don't want Roe v. Wade to be overturned? MCCAIN:  I thought it was a bad decision.  I think there were a\n\t\t\tlot of decisions that were bad.  I think that decisions should rest in\n\t\t\tthe hands of the states.  I'm a federalist.  And I believe strongly\n\t\t\tthat we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based\n\t\t\ton their qualifications rather than any litmus test.  \n\t\t\t     Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the\n\t\t\tUnited States Senate was about to blow up.  Republicans wanted to have\n\t\t\tjust a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were\n\t\t\tblocking in an unprecedented fashion. We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.  You were\n\t\t\toffered a chance to join.  You chose not to because you were afraid of\n\t\t\tthe appointment of, quote, \"conservative judges.\" I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.  Not because I\n\t\t\tagreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified\n\t\t\tand that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.\n\t\t\tThis is a very important issue we're talking about. Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on\n\t\t\tthe grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.  That's\n\t\t\tnot the way we should judge these nominees.  Elections have\n\t\t\tconsequences.  They should be judged on their qualifications.  And so\n\t\t\tthat's what I will do. I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States\n\t\t\tof America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.\n\t\t\tAnd not legislating from the bench. SCHIEFFER:  But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a\n\t\t\thistory of being for abortion rights, you would consider them? MCCAIN:  I would consider anyone in their qualifications.  I do\n\t\t\tnot believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be\n\t\t\tpart of those qualifications.  But I certainly would not impose any\n\t\t\tlitmus test. SCHIEFFER:  All right. OBAMA:  Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict\n\t\t\tlitmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their\n\t\t\tcapacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people. And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most\n\t\t\tconsequential decisions of the next president.  It is very likely that\n\t\t\tone of us will be making at least one and probably more than one\n\t\t\tappointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance. Now I would not provide a litmus test.  But I am somebody who\n\t\t\tbelieves that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.  I think that\n\t\t\tabortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one\n\t\t\tthat I think good people on both sides can disagree on. But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with\n\t\t\ttheir families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the\n\t\t\tbest position to make this decision.  And I think that the\n\t\t\tConstitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to\n\t\t\tstate referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject\n\t\t\tto state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we\n\t\t\thave should be subject to popular vote. OBAMA:  So this is going to be an important issue.  I will look\n\t\t\tfor those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the\n\t\t\tintellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are\n\t\t\tgoing through. I'll just give you one quick example.  Senator McCain and I\n\t\t\tdisagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a\n\t\t\twoman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination. For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been\n\t\t\tpaid for doing the exact same job.  And when she brought a suit,\n\t\t\tsaying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's\n\t\t\ttaken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know\n\t\t\tabout it until fairly recently. We tried to overturn it in the Senate.  I supported that effort\n\t\t\tto provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it. I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a\n\t\t\twoman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her\n\t\t\tfamily, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up,\n\t\t\tif nobody else will.  And that's the kind of judge that I want. SCHIEFFER:  Time's up. MCCAIN:  Obviously, that law waved the statute of limitations,\n\t\t\twhich you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.  It was a trial\n\t\t\tlawyer's dream. Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.  We\n\t\t\thave to change the culture of America.  Those of us who are proudly\n\t\t\tpro-life understand that.  And it's got to be courage and compassion\n\t\t\tthat we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult\n\t\t\tdecision. Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in\n\t\t\tthe Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate\n\t\t\tmedical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.  He voted\n\t\t\tagainst that. And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times\n\t\t\tas a state senator, he voted present. Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\t\t\tin the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a\n\t\t\tban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really\n\t\t\t-- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.  And then, on the floor of\n\t\t\tthe Illinois State Senate, he voted present. I don't know how you vote \"present\" on some of that.  I don't\n\t\t\tknow how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro-\n\t\t\tabortion movement in America.  And that's his record, and that's a\n\t\t\tmatter of his record. And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the\n\t\t\tIllinois State Senate.  It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama\n\t\t\tvoted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of\n\t\t\tmainstream America. SCHIEFFER:  Response? OBAMA:  Yes, let me respond to this.  If it sounds incredible\n\t\t\tthat I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant,\n\t\t\tthat's because it's not true.  The -- here are the facts. There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate\n\t\t\tthat said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have\n\t\t\thelped to undermine Roe v. Wade.  The fact is that there was already a\n\t\t\tlaw on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving\n\t\t\ttreatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and\n\t\t\tDemocrats voted against it. And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in\n\t\t\tIllinois, voted against it.  Their Hippocratic Oath would have\n\t\t\trequired them to provide care, and there was already a law in the\n\t\t\tbooks. With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely\n\t\t\tsupportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or\n\t\t\totherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and\n\t\t\tlife, and this did not contain that exception. And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so\n\t\t\tthat it is constitutional.  And that was rejected, and that's why I\n\t\t\tvoted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term\n\t\t\tabortions as long as we have that exception. The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.  This is\n\t\t\tan issue that -- look, it divides us.  And in some ways, it may be\n\t\t\tdifficult to -- to reconcile the two views. But there surely is some common ground when both those who\n\t\t\tbelieve in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come\n\t\t\ttogether and say, \"We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by\n\t\t\tproviding appropriate education to our youth, communicating that\n\t\t\tsexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier\n\t\t\tactivity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single\n\t\t\tmothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\" Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for\n\t\t\tthe first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some\n\t\t\tcommon ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.  I think it's always a\n\t\t\ttragic situation. OBAMA:  We should try to reduce these circumstances. SCHIEFFER:  Let's give Senator McCain a short response... MCCAIN:  Just again... SCHIEFFER:  ... and then... MCCAIN:  Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator\n\t\t\tObama.  He's health for the mother.  You know, that's been stretched\n\t\t\tby the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything. That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, \"health.\"  But,\n\t\t\tlook, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.  We know what a treasure and\n\t\t\tjoy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.  We'll do everything\n\t\t\twe can to improve adoption in this country. But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights\n\t\t\tof the unborn.  Of course, we have to come together.  Of course, we\n\t\t\thave to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and\n\t\t\thelp these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with\n\t\t\ta compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with\n\t\t\tthe courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take\n\t\t\tcare of it. SCHIEFFER:  Let's stop there, because I want to get in a question\n\t\t\ton education and I'm afraid this is going to have to be our last\n\t\t\tquestion, gentlemen. The question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any\n\t\t\tother country on education.  Yet, by every international measurement,\n\t\t\tin math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th\n\t\t\tgrade, we trail most of the countries of the world. The implications of this are clearly obvious.  Some even say it\n\t\t\tposes a threat to our national security. Do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it? The question to Senator Obama first. OBAMA:  This probably has more to do with our economic future\n\t\t\tthan anything and that means it also has a national security\n\t\t\timplication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its\n\t\t\teconomy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military\n\t\t\tpower.\n\t\t\t     So we've got to get our education system right.  Now, typically,\n\t\t\twhat's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or\n\t\t\treform, and I think we need both. In some cases, we are going to have to invest.  Early childhood\n\t\t\teducation, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is\n\t\t\tprepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting\n\t\t\thuge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates,\n\t\t\treduced delinquency rates. I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a\n\t\t\tgeneration of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in\n\t\t\tmath and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional\n\t\t\tdevelopment and support in exchange for higher standards and\n\t\t\taccountability. And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.\n\t\t\tRight now, I meet young people all across the country who either have\n\t\t\tdecided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are\n\t\t\ttaking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's\n\t\t\tvery difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in\n\t\t\tscience, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to\n\t\t\thave a mortgage before they even buy a house. And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every\n\t\t\tstudent, every year, in exchange for some form of community service,\n\t\t\twhether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's\n\t\t\tworking in a community. If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better\n\t\t\tschool system. But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and\n\t\t\tthat's parents.  We can't do it just in the schools.  Parents are\n\t\t\tgoing to have to show more responsibility.  They've got to turn off\n\t\t\tthe TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling\n\t\t\tthat thirst for knowledge that our students need. SCHIEFFER:  Senator McCain? MCCAIN:  Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.\n\t\t\tThere's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in\n\t\t\tAmerica after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child\n\t\t\tto a failed school and that being your only choice? So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key\n\t\t\telements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and\n\t\t\tNew York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where\n\t\t\twe take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. And we find bad teachers another line of work.  And we have to be\n\t\t\table to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and\n\t\t\tMrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school --\n\t\t\ttheir kids to the school of their choice.\n\t\t\t     Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing\n\t\t\tcompetition.  They are providing the kind of competitions that have\n\t\t\tupgraded both schools -- types of schools. Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.  You will\n\t\t\tfind that some of the worst school systems in America get the most\n\t\t\tmoney per student. So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers. MCCAIN:  We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America\n\t\t\tand Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the\n\t\t\tmilitary, can go right to teaching and not have to take these\n\t\t\texaminations which -- or have the certification that some are required\n\t\t\tin some states. Look, we must improve education in this country.  As far as\n\t\t\tcollege education is concerned, we need to make those student loans\n\t\t\tavailable.  We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can\n\t\t\tmeet.  We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.\n\t\t\tAnd we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to\n\t\t\tinflation. SCHIEFFER:  Do you think the federal government should play a\n\t\t\tlarger role in the schools?  And I mean, more federal money? OBAMA:  Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools\n\t\t\tand that's a tradition that has served us well.  But I do think that\n\t\t\tit is important for the federal government to step up and help local\n\t\t\tschool districts do some of the things they need to do. Now we tried to do this under President Bush.  He put forward No\n\t\t\tChild Left Behind.  Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No\n\t\t\tChild Left Behind.  And local school districts end up having more of a\n\t\t\tburden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that\n\t\t\thappened with special education where we did the right thing by saying\n\t\t\tevery school should provide education to kids with special needs, but\n\t\t\twe never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left\n\t\t\tlocal school districts very cash-strapped. So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education,\n\t\t\tproviding teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.\n\t\t\tSenator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just\n\t\t\tmentioned. Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in\n\t\t\tIllinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.  I think it's\n\t\t\timportant to foster competition inside the public schools. And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad\n\t\t\tteachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove\n\t\t\tthemselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our\n\t\t\tkids have to have their best future. Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out\n\t\t\tvouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our\n\t\t\teducation system.  And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's\n\t\t\trecord when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't\n\t\t\tseem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college\n\t\t\tand the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every\n\t\t\tinterest group that comes along. I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think\n\t\t\tthey're our future.  And this is an example of where we are going to\n\t\t\thave to prioritize.  We can't say we're going to do things and then\n\t\t\tnot explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it. And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like\n\t\t\tlowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.\n\t\t\tIt's not going to happen on its own. SCHIEFFER:  What about that, Senator? MCCAIN:  Well, sure.  I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of\n\t\t\tthe program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are\n\t\t\tprovided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and\n\t\t\tsome and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that. Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and\n\t\t\tCindy and your wife have had.  And that is because they wanted to\n\t\t\tchoose the school that they thought was best for their children. And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.\n\t\t\tThat was vouchers.  That was voucher, Senator Obama.  And I'm frankly\n\t\t\tsurprised you didn't pay more attention to that example. Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a\n\t\t\tgreat first beginning in my view.  It had its flaws, it had its\n\t\t\tproblems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in\n\t\t\tAmerica from a nationwide perspective.  And we need to fix a lot of\n\t\t\tthe problems.  We need to sit down and reauthorize it. But, again, spending more money isn't always the answer.  I think\n\t\t\tthe Head Start program is a great program.  A lot of people, including\n\t\t\tme, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.  By the third grade\n\t\t\tmany times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any\n\t\t\tbetter off than the others. Let's reform it.  Let's reform it and fund it.  That was, of\n\t\t\tcourse, out-of-bounds by the Democrats.  We need to reform these\n\t\t\tprograms.  We need to have transparency.  We need to have rewards.\n\t\t\tIt's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and\n\t\t\tthe adequate funding. And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall\n\t\t\tmeeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who\n\t\t\thave autism.  Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.  And\n\t\t\twe'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of\n\t\t\tautism.  And we'll care for these young children.  And all Americans\n\t\t\twill open their wallets and their hearts to do so. MCCAIN:  But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier\n\t\t\tcomments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the\n\t\t\tUnited States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as\n\t\t\twell. And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that\n\t\t\tare reformed.  But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a\n\t\t\tproblem.  And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are\n\t\t\trequested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable\n\t\t\tsystem.  And it's been proven. OBAMA:  I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.\n\t\t\tSenator McCain's absolutely right:  The D.C. school system is in\n\t\t\tterrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.  And we've got a\n\t\t\twonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the\n\t\t\tyoung mayor there to try... MCCAIN:  Who supports vouchers. OBAMA:  ... who initiated -- actually, supports charters. MCCAIN:  She supports vouchers, also. OBAMA:  But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator\n\t\t\tMcCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with\n\t\t\thim on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the\n\t\t\tproblem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to\n\t\t\tincrease the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots. That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an\n\t\t\teducation reform policy from Senator McCain. So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to\n\t\t\thave a president who is going to tackle it head-on.  And that's what I\n\t\t\tintend to do as president. SCHIEFFER:  All right. MCCAIN:  Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we\n\t\t\tshouldn't do it, even though it's working.  I got it. SCHIEFFER:  All right. Gentlemen, we have come to the close.  Before I ask both of you\n\t\t\tfor your closing statements tonight, I'd like to invite our viewers\n\t\t\tand listeners to go to MyDebates.org, where you will find this\n\t\t\tevening's debates and the three that preceded tonight's debate. Now, for the final statements, by a coin toss, Senator McCain\n\t\t\tgoes first. MCCAIN:  Well, thank you again, Bob. Thanks to Hofstra. And it's great to be with you again.  I think we've had a very\n\t\t\thealthy discussion. My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very\n\t\t\tdifficult times and challenges for America.  And they were graphically\n\t\t\tdemonstrated again today. America needs a new direction.  We cannot be satisfied with what\n\t\t\twe've been doing for the last eight years. I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other\n\t\t\tparty, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of\n\t\t\tRights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in\n\t\t\tthis country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I\n\t\t\thave a long record of it. And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.  We have to\n\t\t\tmake health care affordable and available.  We have to make quality\n\t\t\teducation there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few. We have to stop the spending.  We have to stop the spending,\n\t\t\twhich has mortgaged your children's futures. All of these things and all the promises and commitments that\n\t\t\tSenator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base --\n\t\t\twill be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful\n\t\t\tstewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure\n\t\t\tand prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government. That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my\n\t\t\tproposals for the future of this country. I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and\n\t\t\tputting my country first.  As a long line of McCains that have served\n\t\t\tour country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great\n\t\t\thonor of my life, and I've been proud to serve. And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.  I'd be\n\t\t\thonored and humbled. SCHIEFFER:  Senator? OBAMA:  Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for\n\t\t\tmoderating. I think we all know America is going through tough times right\n\t\t\tnow.  The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's\n\t\t\tunwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in\n\t\t\tthe worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to\n\t\t\tadopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've\n\t\t\tseen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result. We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd\n\t\t\tlike to bring. You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your\n\t\t\thomes.  You've shared your stories with me.  And you've confirmed once\n\t\t\tagain the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people. And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead. But we're going to have to invest in the American people again,\n\t\t\tin tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans,\n\t\t\tand college for every young person who wants to go.  In businesses\n\t\t\tthat can create the new energy economy of the future.  In policies\n\t\t\tthat will lift wages and will grow our middle class. These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.  And\n\t\t\tthese are the policies I want to bring to the White House. But it's not going to be easy.  It's not going to be quick.  It\n\t\t\tis going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans,\n\t\t\tindependents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice\n\t\t\tand service and responsibility. I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.  I would ask for your\n\t\t\tvote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of\n\t\t\tserving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly,\n\t\t\ton your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children. Thank you very much. SCHIEFFER:  Senator Obama, Senator McCain, thank you very much. This concludes the final debate.  I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News,\n\t\t\tand I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said -- go\n\t\t\tvote now.  It will make you feel big and strong.  Good night,\n\t\t\teveryone.
