We'll get to our main story on the oil spill \nin a moment, but first a breaking news from overnight.  A car bomb \ndiscovered in New York's Times Square.  Police cleared thousands of \npeople from the streets after finding an SUV loaded with propane tanks, \ngasoline, black powder and a timing device, the makings of what appeared \nto be a crude car bomb.  The situation is now safe, but joining me this \nmorning is Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.  And \nSecretary Napolitano, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions \nabout this. First of all, I know that the federal government is treating this as \na potential terrorist attack and that you have some evidence, you're \ndusting for fingerprints.  But this attempted attack resembles car bomb \nattempts in London and Scotland in 2007.  How concerned are you that \nthis is not an isolated incident? NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now, we have no evidence that it is \nanything other than a one-off, but we are alerting state, local \nofficials around the country, letting them know what is going on.  The \nforensics are being done.  As leads evolve or develop, they will all be \ntracked down.  This is getting attention.  FBI, Department of Homeland \nSecurity, New York City police, everybody is on it. TAPPER:  I got to think that Times Square is one of the most \nsurveilled areas in the entire world.  How close are we to finding a \nsuspect? NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now, it is heavily surveilled, and as you \nknow, there are cameras all over, and so tape is being reviewed.  But \ntraditional forensics are being done in addition to that.  Looking for \nfingerprints, tracking down the vehicle, the license plate number, \nlooking at the timer -- the (inaudible) of the explosive device.  Right \nnow it doesn't look like it's all a very sophisticated one, quite \nfrankly, but looking into that.  So there is a lot of work that's being \ndone, and then of course other intel being developed, and that will \nevolve as the day goes on. TAPPER:  How concerned should the American people be? NAPOLITANO:  Well, Times Square I think is now safe, and I believe \nthat right now, we have no information other than it is a one-off.  But \nnonetheless, we are alerting state and local law enforcement, everybody \nto be on their toes. TAPPER:  OK, great.  We'll come back to you and other Obama \nadministration officials in a second.  Right now, we're going to turn to \nour main interview, and that is the President Obama is heading down to \nthe Gulf Coast this morning for his own assessment of the oil spill, a \nmassive slick almost the size of Connecticut.  It's making its way to \nthe Louisiana coast, threatening wild life, the environment and the \neconomic livelihood of residents there.  Meanwhile, efforts to plug the \ngush almost a mile below the surface have failed. Joining me now for an exclusive interview is Lamar McKay, chairman \nand president of BP America, which owned the well and was leasing the \nrig that blew up.  He joins us from company headquarters in Houston.  \nMr. McKay, thanks for joining us, and first of all, our condolences to \nthe families of the workers who lost their lives. MCKAY:  Thank you, Jake, and thank you for the opportunity to be \nhere today.  This has been a tragic event.  As you mentioned, we had 11 \npeople lose their lives.  We've had people seriously injured, and we've \ngot an event of enormous proportion that we're dealing with. TAPPER:  OK, BP's plans to stop this leak include an underwater dome \nthat you're trying to build to contain the leak, and a whole other rig \nto drill a relief well, what is the latest on the situation?  The relief \nwell could take up to three months to drill.  Where are we in this process? MCKAY:  Jake, let me explain for your viewers exactly what's going \non.  We've got effectively three fronts of attack that we are \naggressively pursuing in partnership with the government.  One is \neffectively stopping the source, stopping the well from flowing.  The \nsecond one is as -- and these are in parallel -- is to work a \ncontainment system, a collection system sub-sea to be able to \neffectively channel the flow up a pipe and into a processing system that \nwe can control at the surface.  Then the third is dealing aggressively, \naggressively with the spill offshore and trying to fight that spill \noffshore, and the fourth is to deal with the -- deal with the, if the \noil touches the shore, to deal with the cleanup and deal with the \nimpacts on shore.  Those are sorts of the fronts that are under way. You mentioned the containment system.  We call it the containment \ndome.  That has been fabricated.  The engineering is being finalized to \nget that mobilized and deployed.  That will probably be in six to eight \ndays, we'll have that deployed. Meanwhile, just so you know, we're still working hard, still working \nhard on the blowout preventer and see if we can actuate this piece of \nevidently failed equipment.  And as you can imagine, this is like doing \nopen-heart surgery at 5,000 feet, with -- in the dark, with \nrobot-controlled submarines. TAPPER:  The government says currently 5,000 barrels of oil a day \nare spilling into the gulf.  Some experts say it might be five times \nthat, 25,000 barrels of oil a day.  How much oil do you think is \nspilling into the gulf? MCKAY:  Well, the estimates of how much oil is coming out are very \ndifficult because you can't measure in any way accurately, so \neffectively what we're doing with the help of NOAA and the rest of the \ngovernment agencies is understand that volume that is inferred \nessentially by surface expression on the top of the water.  So I don't \nknow the volume.  The volume uncertainty -- there is a large uncertainty \nrange around the 5,000 barrels. Our spill response is designed to take that uncertainty into \naccount, and we're responding for that full range of uncertainty with \nall the resources that we can, in conjunction with the government. TAPPER:  Obama administration officials have expressed in recent \ndays concerns that BP is not doing enough.  Other officials have said \nthat you don't have the resources.  Should the government take over this \noperation? MCKAY:  I think we're, as we said from day one, we're throwing every \nresource that we've got at this, and this is now an industry effort.  \nIt's not just a BP effort.  It's an effort in conjunction with the \ngovernment.  And I think the partnership that we've got between industry \nand the government has rallied an effort that is unprecedented in size, \nand I think that that effort is actually working pretty well.  It will \ncontinue to be flexed and expanded where it needs to, and I think, you \nknow, the point here is we are doing everything possible that we know of \n-- and I believe I'm talking about the collective we here -- to control \nthe source first.  That's our first priority.  While in parallel, \nfighting the thing offshore as far as -- as far as possible and as \neffectively as possible, and then dealing with the cleanup and issues \nand impacts on shore should they occur. TAPPER:  Your company, BP, has a spotty safety record, most \nhorrifically in 2005, an explosion at a refinery in Texas that killed 15 \nworkers; other incidents involving leaks have been blamed on cutting \ncorners on financial reasons.  How confident are you that this accident \nhad nothing to do with cutting back on safety to save a buck? MCKAY:  Well, the investigations are going to show the cause of this \naccident, and we want those investigations to be done.  My belief that \nis that that does not have anything to do with it.  I believe we've got \na failed piece of equipment.  We don't know why it failed yet in this \ncontracted rig, and BOP system will figure that out. But let me just tell you, our focus, our focus right now is dealing \nwith the source of the oil, dealing with it on the surface, and dealing \nwith it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs. TAPPER:  Your initial filing to the government, to the Mineral \nManagement Service for 2009 before you drilled on this spot made this \nassessment, quote, \"An accidental oil spill could cause impact to the \nbeaches.  However, due to the distance to shore, 48 miles, and the \nresponse capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse \nimpacts are expected.  BP Exploration and Production Incorporated has \nthe capability to respond to the maximum extent practicable to a \nworst-case discharge,\" which you estimated at 300,000 gallons.  It's \nless than that, it's estimated to be 210,000, and yet BP does not seem \nto have the capability to respond.  How can the public trust BP's \nassessments of risk and how can the public trust anything you guys say? MCKAY:  Well, I think we are responding very, very aggressively.  As \nyou may know, we had a response planned, filed for the drilling of this \nwell that incorporates various capability around the Gulf Coast.  That \nspill response plan was activated as soon as this event occurred.  It \nhas been extremely aggressive.  It will continue to be extremely \naggressive, and I believe the response -- this is, you know, we must \nunderstand, this is -- this is a very low likelihood but very high \nimpact response -- sorry, incident -- and the response is matching that \nincident. TAPPER:  I just have a couple more questions.  Just a few months \nago, a BP executive protested proposed new safety regulations for oil \nrigs, writing to the government that quote, \"while BP is supportive of \ncompanies having a system in place to reduce risks, accidents, injuries \nand spills, we are not supportive of extensive proscriptive \nregulations.\"  Will BP continue to fight and lobby against safety \nregulations? MCKAY:  Well, I would characterize the letter you're talking about \nslightly differently.  That letter was in response to the government's \nrequest for input on safety regulations that the MMS was looking at.  \nThe rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific \nrecommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change \nthem.  So we're not fighting anything about safety.  Safety is the \nnumber one priority.  We're going to figure out what happened here, and \nthat is going to help the MMS and help ourselves and help the industry \nget safer, so we're not fighting anything about safety. TAPPER:  All right, last question, Mr. McKay.  You had several \nfail/safe mechanisms on this rig, and they all failed.  Since you don't \nyet know what caused this accident, will you stop all operations until \nyou know?  How can the American people trust that there won't be another \nexplosion at another BP facility? MCKAY:  Well, we're working in conjunction with the government on \nunderstanding everything we can understand as quickly as we can.  We're \nnot going to do anything that we think is unsafe.  We're doing extra \ntests on various pieces of equipment to make absolutely sure they will \nwork in the condition they're intended to work in. We won't do any work if we don't think it can be carried out safely \nand without impact.  But we are working very closely with the government \nin trying to understand this and see if there should be any changes quickly. TAPPER:  All right.  Lamar McKay, thank you so much for joining us.  \nWe really appreciate your time. MCKAY:  Thank you. TAPPER:  And we're now joined by a powerhouse roundtable.  As \nalways, George Will, from the National Action Network, the Reverend Al \nSharpton, from HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Bill Maher, former \nBush adviser Matthew Dowd, and Katrina vanden Heuvel from The Nation. Thanks, one and all. George, I've heard some conservative critics say that this oil slick \nis President Obama's Katrina.  Is it? WILL:  No.  It might come as a news bulletin to the president \nhimself, but he's not responsible for everything, and bad things \nhappen.  This is a reality check for a nation that's ravenous for energy \nand has to be and always has been.  Getting our sources of energy has \nrisks. The Exxon Valdez called our attention to the fact that it's very \ndangerous shipping oil across the surface of the ocean.  Since the Exxon \nValdez, there have been seven larger tanker spills.  You can go up to \nWest Virginia, where 29 miners are being mourned today, and they will \ntell you about the risks of mining coal.  No one says stop mining coal \nbecause of this. TAPPER:  Reverend, some critics -- not just from the right -- are \nsaying that the Obama administration was slow.  The New York Times \neditorial board faulted the Obama administration.  Is that unfair criticism? SHARPTON:  Well, I think so.  I think that when you look at the fact \nthat, first of all, this has been an evolving crisis -- this did not \nhappen -- unlike Katrina, where you had a natural disaster that \nimmediately blanketed the whole area and we were watching it live on \ntelevision, this got worse over time. And I think that there's evidence that the White House has put out \n-- I've not talked to them, but I've read this on their Web site -- of \nhow they met each rising crisis with personnel there, cabinet members \nthere, now the president going, unlike George Bush, that said he didn't \nsee the crisis, and we sat there four or five days and watched it live \non television.  So I think any analogy is absolutely ridiculous. TAPPER:  Bill, I was watching your show Friday night... MAHER:  Morning. TAPPER:  ... and you said, in language more suitable for premium \ncable... MAHER:  I promise I won't here.  They're so nervous about that. TAPPER:  ... that you're surprised President Obama isn't getting \nmore, shall we say, guff for... MAHER:  Exactly. TAPPER:  ... for this crisis. MAHER:  Yes, I think he should.  You know, he owns this issue now, \nbecause it was only a few weeks ago that he came out for offshore \ndrilling.  And I would say philosophically this is -- you know, the \nproblem, I think, a lot of people on the left have with this country and \nhave for many years, is that there's no one who really represents our \npoint of view. There's two parties who want to fight the war on terror with an army \nin Afghanistan.  There's two parties who want to drill offshore.  Where \nis the other side on this? So, you know, I could certainly criticize oil companies, and I could \ncriticize America in general for not attacking this problem in the \n'70s.  I mean, Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years.  We certainly \ncould have. But it is very disappointing, I think, for this president to be \ntaking a position, as he had -- and I guess he's backpedaling now on it, \nI hope.  I mean, I hope there's a flip-flop I can believe in there.  But... TAPPER:  There's a slogan for you, flip-flops I can believe in. MAHER:  I could believe in that one, and I hope he does. TAPPER:  Matt, where's the public on this issue? DOWD:  Well, I think the public -- I mean, first of all, the public \ndoesn't think there's any equal nature to Katrina and this.  I mean, \nKatrina, obviously, evacuated -- having to evacuate an entire area and \nwhat that issue was, was such a different issue than this. But I think where the public is on this, if you put this in the \ncontext of what happened in West Virginia and the mine disaster and this \nin context of Katrina, even though it was different, and this in context \nin many things, I think the public sits there and says, \"Who's in \ncharge?  Who is accountable, and who can -- what governmental entity can \nactually be effective in doing anything?\" And I think that ultimately is where the public is.  It's just \nanother example of a fact that we cannot trust the government to do \nanything that we need them to do, from mines to even a belief (ph) on \nhealth care to -- to the oil spill.  It's a loss of faith, I think, \nagain, in the government. VANDEN HEUVEL:  What we've seen are the risks are too great.  \nOffshore drilling is the problem, not the solution.  This is not \nKatrina, 1,500 dead, hundreds of thousands homeless. I think more important is to understand that we now need a \ngovernment that is going to regulate a company, BP, which was a serial \nabuser of workers and of safety regulations.  Just like Massey, we need \nregulations... TAPPER:  Massey, with the -- with the West Virginia mine. VANDEN HEUVEL:  ... tough enforcement -- the mines -- we need a \ngovernment that understands that.  I would also point out that this was \nthe week that for the first time an offshore wind farm was approved.  \nAnd George Will may not see a future in that, but I believe we need a \nManhattan Project, an Apollo Alliance to ramp up public and private \ninvestment. At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D.  We can \ndo better.  We are a nation which should do better, George, and not rely \non dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country \nand the planet. TAPPER:  Mr. Will, your name has been invoked. WILL:  Well, one in five steps of an approval process has now been \ntaken for the wind farm, vigorously opposed by people who are all in \nfavor of renewable energy elsewhere, because they think it'll spoil \ntheir view. TAPPER:  This is the wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts that a \nlot of people... WILL:  The wind farm on Cape Cod, yes. TAPPER:  ... including the Kennedy family, were fighting tooth and nail. WILL:  Right.  And -- and, by the way, wind farms kill a lot more \nbirds daily than are probably going to be killed in this oil spill. And so -- but I'd like to go back to Bill.  Could you just explain \nto me in what sense Brazil got off oil? MAHER:  I believe they did.  I believe they, in the '70s, they had a \nprogram to use sugarcane ethanol.  And I believe that is what fuels \ntheir country. WILL:  I think they still burn a lot of oil and have a lot of it \noffshore. VANDEN HEUVEL:  But, George, you're a man who understands there are \nalways alternatives in politics and in science.  We can -- you know, why \nshould we be relying on what we are now seeing the risks of? And, by the way, we can do better with existing oil fields.  We can \nget as much from existing oil fields, which the oil companies for profit \nreasons aren't doing much with.  So I just think we have seen the risks \nand we need to take action.  It is just too much to look at what is \ngoing on in the gulf and what will happen if it moves into the Arctic. And I agree with Bill.  I think President Obama was pandering when \nhe moved to this offshore drilling stance.  But I think this White House \nhas the ability, unlike previous White Houses, to understand and see the \nlight and take a different step. MAHER:  And could we have judges fact-check this on Brazil?  I don't \nknow... (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  ... dreamed that about Brazil. (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  ... and Brazil, let's get back to the United States.  I \nthink that Katrina's right.  I think that there's a challenge here.  And \nI think that the president and the country has to deal with the reality \nthat we're facing. And I think that the reality is that usually it's not about who's \ngoing to speak for the left or right.  It's, who's going to be right on \nthese issues?  We see what can happen here.  Now what do we do about \nit?  And I think that, clearly, a failure to stand up and lead at this \npoint is something that all of us would criticize. But I'm not convinced that this president won't.  I think he's going \ndown there, he's going to reassess.  And I think that we've got to see \nwhere that goes and if he goes, right, support him, and I think he will. But I think to act like this is Katrina, I think this is the step \nwithout -- beyond the realm of a sane discussion. TAPPER:  OK.  We're going to take a quick break and come back, and \nthe roundtable will discuss the far less controversial issue -- that's \nsarcastic -- about immigration law and Florida Governor Charlie Crist's \ndeclaration of independence.  And later, of course, the Sunday funnies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COLBERT:  There is an impending environmental disaster looming right \noff our nation's fragile coastline.  I'm speaking, of course, about the \nnew wind farm off of Cape Cod.  What if it breaks and we have a \ncatastrophic wind spill? (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (UNKNOWN):  And if the feds won't come in and protect us, then we \nwill come forward and protect ourselves.  We -- we have no other \nchoice.  We have -- we have a right, Greta, to feel free in our state \nand to feel safe.  And with what's going on, we have many, many people \nthat feel that they are not safe. (UNKNOWN):  Si se puede!  Si se puede!  Si se puede! OBAMA:  If you are a Hispanic American in Arizona, if you don't have \nyour papers and you took your kid out to get ice cream, you're going to \nbe harassed, that's something that could potentially happen, that's not \nthe right way to go. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER:  And we're back with our roundtable.  As always, George \nWill, the Reverend Al Sharpton from the National Action Network, the \nhost of HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Bill Maher, Matthew Dowd, \nformer Bush adviser, and Katrina vanden Heuvel of The Nation. Reverend Sharpton, I want to start with you.  You're going to be \nparticipating in leading a march and a rally and a vigil in Arizona on \nWednesday to protest this immigration reform law.  What do you think the \ncitizens of Arizona should do with the fact that there is this big \nillegal immigration problem? SHARPTON:  Well, first of all, I think we need to have real \nimmigration reform from a federal level.  The federal government is \nsupposed to set immigration policy, and I think that all of our forces \nought to really try to put the pressure there, which is something all of \nus advocated doing the last two general elections. To try and now say that because that has not happened -- and all of \nus agree it should -- that we're now going to have state law and open \nthe door to racial profiling is what we're objecting to and protesting \non Wednesday and have said since the law was signed Friday before last. And this, unlike many of the critics of those of us that protest \nthis, this is not about protecting illegal immigrants.  This is about \nprotecting legal citizens.  If you are Hispanic or thought to be \nHispanic in the state of Arizona, you can be faced (ph) and subjected to \nan harassment that other citizens should not.  That's a violation of \nequal protection under the law. We would not tolerate that to people that look like George if this \nwas a law saying we're looking for people that look Canadian in the \nstate of Vermont.  That would be racial profiling. Citizens that are here, that have -- that have not broken any laws \nshould not be subjected to anything different than any other citizens.  \nIt's not about illegal immigrants.  It's about legal Latino citizens \nthat should not be targeted, and this law does that. TAPPER:  Matthew? DOWD:  To me, Arizona is a sideshow, and it's symptomatic of a \nbigger problem.  And I don't think this is about the Arizona law.  This \nis about people in a state -- and it's out going on all over the country \n-- that they see a federal government that's unwilling to enforce a law \nthat's already on the books. There is an immigration law on the books.  It is illegal to come \ninto this country.  Arizona for years and years and years, including \nunder the previous guest, Governor Napolitano, has asked the federal \ngovernment to enforce the law, which they refuse to do in this -- in \nthis context. So it's not about a new law passed.  It's about a state says that we \nthink the federal government should enforce the law.  They're not \nenforcing the law, so we're going to enforce the law. I don't think it's the right response.  I think we need the federal \ngovernment to step up and actually perform an immigration policy.  But \nit's not about Arizona. (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  The federal law... TAPPER:  Reverend Sharpton... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... does not say that, based on reasonable suspicion of \nthe police, they can go after someone which targets people that are \nLatino, since you're dealing with a problem with Mexicans coming across \nthe border.  The federal law does not say that, does not target that.  \nWe agree the federal laws should be looked at, reformed, and enforced, \nbut to say that you're going to sacrifice the civil rights of Latinos \nand people of color because the federal government has not moved \nforward, I think, is very irresponsible. TAPPER:  George? WILL:  The Arizona law does not say that there should be racial \nprofiling.  And let me tell you what the... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  Well, then why did they just reform it over the weekend... (CROSSTALK) WILL:  Let me tell you what the federal law says.  \"Every alien 18 \nyears of age and older shall at all times carry with him and have in his \npersonal possession a certificate of alien registration or alien \nregistration receipt card issued to him.\"  That's been federal law for \n58 years. All that Arizona has done is say we at the state level are going to \nreinforce the federal law.  This is legal.  In 2008, the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, the most liberal circuit court in this country, \naffirmed the constitutionality of an Arizona law that made it a state \ncrime for employers to hire illegal immigrants.  This is not bizarre \nbehavior on Arizona's part. SHARPTON:  The state law does not say -- the state law says that a \npoliceman, under reasonable suspicion -- it did not -- it does not say \nthat in the federal law -- can go and make someone produce and document \ntheir citizenship.  It does not say what you just read... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  With all due respect, Mr. Will, that is not what that \nfederal law says.  And the recognition of that is the state of Arizona's \nlegislature just refined what they said over the weekend.  They \nconceited that we were right and they had to refine it. (CROSSTALK) WILL:  ... 50 years of case law refining the concept of reasonable \nsuspicion.  This is not a blank slate, Reverend. VANDEN HEUVEL:  Mr. Will, why is the law enforcement community in \nArizona so deeply divided?  I find that an interesting problem. SHARPTON:  Absolutely. VANDEN HEUVEL:  You have police chiefs who believe that this will \nendanger the public safety and security of the state and its citizens.  \nYou also have -- these are pragmatic, not moral reasons, even though \nthis bill is state-sanctioned racial profiling and draconian, ugly, \nmean-spirited -- but you have a $3 billion budget deficit in Arizona.  \nThis may well loot that state's treasury as they fight this bill. You're going to have economic boycotts, which you disagree with, but \nyou're going to have them, as you had them to push that state to respect \nMartin Luther King holiday. And finally, you have a situation where the crime rates in Arizona \nhave declined over this last decade, and you have a border guard which \nhas tripled since 2004.  The budget has increased money for security.  I \npersonally think the security piece is overstated.  You want to ensure \nan orderly flow of people and goods.  But you need a humane pathway to \ncitizenship. TAPPER:  Bill, what do you say to Arizona's citizens who are \nfrustrated with the federal government, the law is not being enforced, \nthere is an influx of illegal immigrants -- some of them, obviously not \nall of them, but some of them are involved in crimes -- what are they \nsupposed to do? MAHER:  Well, I would hope the Constitution of the country is a \nlittle more important to them.  I know that's asking a lot. WILL:  What constitutional provision does this violate? MAHER:  Well, I mean, nobody's been able to articulate a scenario \nwhere the police are stopping people for any other reason than they look \nMexican and poor.  You know, it kind of reminds me of -- what, was it \nPotter Stewart on the Supreme Court said about pornography, \"I know it \nwhen I see it\"?  That seems to be the standard the police are now using \nwith immigration. TAPPER:  I think what... SHARPTON:  There's something called equal protection under the law. (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  The law has -- the law has -- to be fair to Governor Jan \nBrewer of Arizona, she signed an executive order the same day that she \nsigned a law that said that a person's race alone cannot be enough to be \nreasonable suspicion.  There needs to be more than... SHARPTON:  And now she's come back this weekend with something \nelse.  So are we going to keep redoing it?  I think you'd have to \nconcede that had this not been raised and these protests had not -- they \nwould not themselves be now doing the moonwalk against their own bill. DOWD:  Jake, I think the situation is -- we keep falling back into \nan Arizona problem.  The majority of the country... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  People in Arizona have an Arizona problem. DOWD:  No, the people of this country have an immigration problem. SHARPTON:  I agree. DOWD:  The majority of this country supports what Arizona did, the \nmajority of the country.  And two-thirds of people in Arizona support \nthis.  Do I think that the Arizona response is the right thing?  No.  \nBut do I think that it represents a frustration with the federal \ngovernment, just like what's going on in Wall Street -- the people of \nthis country see Washington -- Democrats and Republicans -- complicit in \nwhat we do. We don't enforce the laws on Wall Street, so we have a huge problem \nthere.  We don't enforce the immigration laws, so states like Arizona \nreact in this way, which I don't think is actually reasonable.  But I -- \nit's reasonable for them to be frustrated with the problem. TAPPER:  Bill? MAHER:  The government intrusion, you know, government power is \nsomething that really bothers conservatives, unless it's directed toward \npeople who aren't white.  You know, I mean, it does seem like there's \nsome of that going on there.  I mean... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  Let me just interject.  To be fair to conservatives, \nVirginia Governor Bob McDonnell, a conservative Republican, and Florida \nCongressman Connie Mack have had some tough words about parts of this \nlaw.  Here's McDonnell on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCDONNELL:  I'm concerned about the whole idea of carrying papers \nand always have to be able to prove your citizenship.  That brings up \nshades of some other regimes that were not particularly helpful to \ndemocracy and civil rights. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER:  And Florida Congressman Connie Mack said in a press \nrelease, \"This law of frontier justice, where law enforcement officials \nare required to stop anyone based on reasonable suspicion that they may \nbe in the country illegally, is reminiscent of a time during World War \nII when the Gestapo in Germany stopped people on the street and asked \nfor their papers without probable cause.\" George, these are conservative Republicans, very -- I mean, nobody \nwould question Bob McDonnell's bona fides as a conservative.  And they \nare voicing serious concern about this law. WILL:  Yes.  To enter Mr. McDonnell's Capitol building or to enter \nthe House office building where Connie Mack works, you have to show a \ngovernment-issued ID.  I mean, this is -- this is synthetic hysteria by \na herd of independent minds called our political class right now that \nhas decided to stand up and worry about the Constitution being shredded \nby measures that have ample history of being sustained against \nconstitutional challenges. Now, Mr. Maher just said, if I heard him right, that conservatives \nbasically are racists and they like government intrusion only against \npeople who aren't white.  I mean, that's the level... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  We'll come to you in one second... (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  Can you -- can you imagine if some of the -- what's going on \nwith the Tea Party rallies, if they were a group of black people, you \nknow, waving guns, coming up armed, talking about how you might -- you \nknow, hinting about how you might have to take matters into your own \nhands if the government doesn't do what you want?  Do you think the \nreaction in this country would be... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... very important point that needs to be addressed.  \nWhen you say, Mr. Will, that if you go to Mr. McDonnell's building or \nCongressman Mack's building, you have to show ID, that is the point.  \nEveryone has to show ID.  They do not have guards stand there and say, \n\"Only you that I deem to be reasonably suspect because I think you come \nfrom a particular group that may be entering the building to do harm, \nwe're going to search you.\"  Everyone is searched. This is not the case in the Arizona law.  This is not the case of \nwhat's going on in the raids with Sheriff Arpaio there.  And this is not \nwhat we're protesting.  If everyone was subjected to that, like the \nbuildings you referred to, there would be no cause for concern. VANDEN HEUVEL:  And for George to talk about synthetic hysteria, I \nmean, your colleague at the Washington Post, Michael Gerson, took \nserious issue with the column you wrote underneath, saying that this \nissue is going to sort Republicans and conservatives politically, morally. I think Latino-bashing, which is what this is, is ultimately \npolitical suicide for the Republican Party.  I also think... WILL:  Have you read the Democratic immigration bill? VANDEN HEUVEL:  I also think that, on the media front, I very much \nhope that Reverend Sharpton's march in Arizona next week, as the marches \non Wall Street demanding accountability for jobs lost and greed, what \nit's done to this country, get the same attention as six Tea Partiers \namassed on a corner get in the media. (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  Let me defend myself, because I was -- just what he said \nabout rephrasing my -- I would never say -- and I have never said, \nbecause it's not true -- that Republicans, all Republicans are racist.  \nThat would be silly and wrong.  But nowadays, if you are racist, you're \nprobably a Republican. TAPPER:  Well, let's leave that... (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  And that is quite different. TAPPER:  Let's leave that topic -- that's a -- that's a whole other \nroundtable conversation. But, George, you did bring up a topic about the Democratic \nimmigration reform bill that I wanted to touch on, because Democrats are \nnow shopping around -- they're trying to find Republican co-sponsors for \ntheir immigration reform bill.  And it is a tough immigration reform \nbill.  I mean, it does have a path to citizenship, but it also has some \ntough measures in there. WILL:  It says enforcement first, close the border, later we will \nworry about comprehensive reform.  It could have been written by \nRepublicans. TAPPER:  And, also, part of it is -- and, Bill, you touched on this \non your show the other night -- is it has a national ID card.  Here's \npart of the Democratic bill that says, \"The card will possess biometric \nidentifiers in the form of templates that definitively tie the \nindividual user to the identity credential within five years of the date \nof enactment.  This fraud-proof Social Security card will serve as the \nsole acceptable document to be produced by an employee to an employer \nfor employment verification purposes.\" This is the Democratic bill. SHARPTON:  So I'm sure Mr. Will is going to endorse that this \nmorning and make news. TAPPER:  Well, but do you have an issue with that? SHARPTON:  I'm asking him. TAPPER:  But I'm asking you, and it's my show.  Do you -- do you -- \ndo you... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  Do you have an issue with that? SHARPTON:  I would have some very serious questions about some of \nthe aspects of the Democratic bill, but I'm going to see what ultimately \nends up being the Democratic bill.  And I'm sure a lot of us in the \ncivil rights community will question parts of it. What I go back to, though, it is interesting to me that those on the \nright that is headed by Brother Will here has not cheered this on.  If \nhe said it could have been written by a Republican, then why didn't he \nwrite in his column this morning that he supports it? WILL:  What enforcement of immigration laws do you support? SHARPTON:  You don't answer a question with a question.  I'm asking \nyou, would you support the bill... (CROSSTALK) WILL:  Let the record show... (CROSSTALK) WILL:  Let the record show that the Reverend Sharpton stipulates no \nenforcement... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... answer to my question. (CROSSTALK) VANDEN HEUVEL:  ... overweighted on enforcement. SHARPTON:  Absolutely. VANDEN HEUVEL:  By the way, I think the security card is a \nnon-starter, because you have the coalition of privacy advocates meeting \nthose who are deeply suspicious of government.  I don't think that goes \nanywhere. But I do think we need to fight for a comprehensive reform bill, and \nthe Republicans are not signing on anything. DOWD:  OK, so -- so we can give some proper history to this, the \nfirst person to really offer and push for comprehensive immigration \nreform was George W. Bush, which the Democrats and every -- at every \nplace and every time on everything tried to stop.  To me... VANDEN HEUVEL:  Not Senator Kennedy. DOWD:  ... if we don't -- to me, this conversation is another \nexample why people that tune in and people that think they're going to \nget an answer from Washington, from Democrats or Republicans, on almost \nany issue, whether it's protecting the environment, whether it's \nstopping things on Wall Street, whether it's immigration reform, whether \nit's enforcement of any law, that is why they're fed up. Now, we can discount the Tea Party movement and say, \"Oh, they're a \nbunch of crazies.\"  They are symptomatic of a situation in the country \nwhich has lost total faith and trust in what goes on... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  We only have -- Katrina, I'm sorry -- we only have 30 more \nseconds, and, Bill, I do want to give you the last word to respond to \nGeorge.  What should be done to protect the border? MAHER:  I pass. (CROSSTALK) VANDEN HEUVEL:  There are other movements -- there are other \nmovements outside of Washington.  You talked just about the Tea \nPartiers.  The thousands who've massed this past week to protest what \nWall Street has done to our economy... SHARPTON:  Absolutely. VANDEN HEUVEL:  ... the immigration rights marches... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  There are clear immigration problems... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... for opening the borders, but that does not excuse \nviolating people's civil rights.  One does not have to be sacrificed... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  Reverend Sharpton, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave \nit there. SHARPTON:  And it's your show. TAPPER:  And it's my show.  And you guys will talk about Charlie \nCrist -- we didn't get time to do that.  We'll talk about that in the \ngreen room, and the roundtable will continue in the green room on \nabcnews.com.  Later, check out our fact checks.  \"This Week\" and \nPolitiFact have joined together to fact check our newsmakers, only on \n\"This Week.\" END.  TAPPER:  Good morning.  We'll get to our main story on the oil spill \nin a moment, but first a breaking news from overnight.  A car bomb \ndiscovered in New York's Times Square.  Police cleared thousands of \npeople from the streets after finding an SUV loaded with propane tanks, \ngasoline, black powder and a timing device, the makings of what appeared \nto be a crude car bomb.  The situation is now safe, but joining me this \nmorning is Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.  And \nSecretary Napolitano, I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions \nabout this. First of all, I know that the federal government is treating this as \na potential terrorist attack and that you have some evidence, you're \ndusting for fingerprints.  But this attempted attack resembles car bomb \nattempts in London and Scotland in 2007.  How concerned are you that \nthis is not an isolated incident? NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now, we have no evidence that it is \nanything other than a one-off, but we are alerting state, local \nofficials around the country, letting them know what is going on.  The \nforensics are being done.  As leads evolve or develop, they will all be \ntracked down.  This is getting attention.  FBI, Department of Homeland \nSecurity, New York City police, everybody is on it. TAPPER:  I got to think that Times Square is one of the most \nsurveilled areas in the entire world.  How close are we to finding a \nsuspect? NAPOLITANO:  Well, right now, it is heavily surveilled, and as you \nknow, there are cameras all over, and so tape is being reviewed.  But \ntraditional forensics are being done in addition to that.  Looking for \nfingerprints, tracking down the vehicle, the license plate number, \nlooking at the timer -- the (inaudible) of the explosive device.  Right \nnow it doesn't look like it's all a very sophisticated one, quite \nfrankly, but looking into that.  So there is a lot of work that's being \ndone, and then of course other intel being developed, and that will \nevolve as the day goes on. TAPPER:  How concerned should the American people be? NAPOLITANO:  Well, Times Square I think is now safe, and I believe \nthat right now, we have no information other than it is a one-off.  But \nnonetheless, we are alerting state and local law enforcement, everybody \nto be on their toes. TAPPER:  OK, great.  We'll come back to you and other Obama \nadministration officials in a second.  Right now, we're going to turn to \nour main interview, and that is the President Obama is heading down to \nthe Gulf Coast this morning for his own assessment of the oil spill, a \nmassive slick almost the size of Connecticut.  It's making its way to \nthe Louisiana coast, threatening wild life, the environment and the \neconomic livelihood of residents there.  Meanwhile, efforts to plug the \ngush almost a mile below the surface have failed. Joining me now for an exclusive interview is Lamar McKay, chairman \nand president of BP America, which owned the well and was leasing the \nrig that blew up.  He joins us from company headquarters in Houston.  \nMr. McKay, thanks for joining us, and first of all, our condolences to \nthe families of the workers who lost their lives. MCKAY:  Thank you, Jake, and thank you for the opportunity to be \nhere today.  This has been a tragic event.  As you mentioned, we had 11 \npeople lose their lives.  We've had people seriously injured, and we've \ngot an event of enormous proportion that we're dealing with. TAPPER:  OK, BP's plans to stop this leak include an underwater dome \nthat you're trying to build to contain the leak, and a whole other rig \nto drill a relief well, what is the latest on the situation?  The relief \nwell could take up to three months to drill.  Where are we in this process? MCKAY:  Jake, let me explain for your viewers exactly what's going \non.  We've got effectively three fronts of attack that we are \naggressively pursuing in partnership with the government.  One is \neffectively stopping the source, stopping the well from flowing.  The \nsecond one is as -- and these are in parallel -- is to work a \ncontainment system, a collection system sub-sea to be able to \neffectively channel the flow up a pipe and into a processing system that \nwe can control at the surface.  Then the third is dealing aggressively, \naggressively with the spill offshore and trying to fight that spill \noffshore, and the fourth is to deal with the -- deal with the, if the \noil touches the shore, to deal with the cleanup and deal with the \nimpacts on shore.  Those are sorts of the fronts that are under way. You mentioned the containment system.  We call it the containment \ndome.  That has been fabricated.  The engineering is being finalized to \nget that mobilized and deployed.  That will probably be in six to eight \ndays, we'll have that deployed. Meanwhile, just so you know, we're still working hard, still working \nhard on the blowout preventer and see if we can actuate this piece of \nevidently failed equipment.  And as you can imagine, this is like doing \nopen-heart surgery at 5,000 feet, with -- in the dark, with \nrobot-controlled submarines. TAPPER:  The government says currently 5,000 barrels of oil a day \nare spilling into the gulf.  Some experts say it might be five times \nthat, 25,000 barrels of oil a day.  How much oil do you think is \nspilling into the gulf? MCKAY:  Well, the estimates of how much oil is coming out are very \ndifficult because you can't measure in any way accurately, so \neffectively what we're doing with the help of NOAA and the rest of the \ngovernment agencies is understand that volume that is inferred \nessentially by surface expression on the top of the water.  So I don't \nknow the volume.  The volume uncertainty -- there is a large uncertainty \nrange around the 5,000 barrels. Our spill response is designed to take that uncertainty into \naccount, and we're responding for that full range of uncertainty with \nall the resources that we can, in conjunction with the government. TAPPER:  Obama administration officials have expressed in recent \ndays concerns that BP is not doing enough.  Other officials have said \nthat you don't have the resources.  Should the government take over this \noperation? MCKAY:  I think we're, as we said from day one, we're throwing every \nresource that we've got at this, and this is now an industry effort.  \nIt's not just a BP effort.  It's an effort in conjunction with the \ngovernment.  And I think the partnership that we've got between industry \nand the government has rallied an effort that is unprecedented in size, \nand I think that that effort is actually working pretty well.  It will \ncontinue to be flexed and expanded where it needs to, and I think, you \nknow, the point here is we are doing everything possible that we know of \n-- and I believe I'm talking about the collective we here -- to control \nthe source first.  That's our first priority.  While in parallel, \nfighting the thing offshore as far as -- as far as possible and as \neffectively as possible, and then dealing with the cleanup and issues \nand impacts on shore should they occur. TAPPER:  Your company, BP, has a spotty safety record, most \nhorrifically in 2005, an explosion at a refinery in Texas that killed 15 \nworkers; other incidents involving leaks have been blamed on cutting \ncorners on financial reasons.  How confident are you that this accident \nhad nothing to do with cutting back on safety to save a buck? MCKAY:  Well, the investigations are going to show the cause of this \naccident, and we want those investigations to be done.  My belief that \nis that that does not have anything to do with it.  I believe we've got \na failed piece of equipment.  We don't know why it failed yet in this \ncontracted rig, and BOP system will figure that out. But let me just tell you, our focus, our focus right now is dealing \nwith the source of the oil, dealing with it on the surface, and dealing \nwith it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs. TAPPER:  Your initial filing to the government, to the Mineral \nManagement Service for 2009 before you drilled on this spot made this \nassessment, quote, \"An accidental oil spill could cause impact to the \nbeaches.  However, due to the distance to shore, 48 miles, and the \nresponse capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse \nimpacts are expected.  BP Exploration and Production Incorporated has \nthe capability to respond to the maximum extent practicable to a \nworst-case discharge,\" which you estimated at 300,000 gallons.  It's \nless than that, it's estimated to be 210,000, and yet BP does not seem \nto have the capability to respond.  How can the public trust BP's \nassessments of risk and how can the public trust anything you guys say? MCKAY:  Well, I think we are responding very, very aggressively.  As \nyou may know, we had a response planned, filed for the drilling of this \nwell that incorporates various capability around the Gulf Coast.  That \nspill response plan was activated as soon as this event occurred.  It \nhas been extremely aggressive.  It will continue to be extremely \naggressive, and I believe the response -- this is, you know, we must \nunderstand, this is -- this is a very low likelihood but very high \nimpact response -- sorry, incident -- and the response is matching that \nincident. TAPPER:  I just have a couple more questions.  Just a few months \nago, a BP executive protested proposed new safety regulations for oil \nrigs, writing to the government that quote, \"while BP is supportive of \ncompanies having a system in place to reduce risks, accidents, injuries \nand spills, we are not supportive of extensive proscriptive \nregulations.\"  Will BP continue to fight and lobby against safety \nregulations? MCKAY:  Well, I would characterize the letter you're talking about \nslightly differently.  That letter was in response to the government's \nrequest for input on safety regulations that the MMS was looking at.  \nThe rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific \nrecommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change \nthem.  So we're not fighting anything about safety.  Safety is the \nnumber one priority.  We're going to figure out what happened here, and \nthat is going to help the MMS and help ourselves and help the industry \nget safer, so we're not fighting anything about safety. TAPPER:  All right, last question, Mr. McKay.  You had several \nfail/safe mechanisms on this rig, and they all failed.  Since you don't \nyet know what caused this accident, will you stop all operations until \nyou know?  How can the American people trust that there won't be another \nexplosion at another BP facility? MCKAY:  Well, we're working in conjunction with the government on \nunderstanding everything we can understand as quickly as we can.  We're \nnot going to do anything that we think is unsafe.  We're doing extra \ntests on various pieces of equipment to make absolutely sure they will \nwork in the condition they're intended to work in. We won't do any work if we don't think it can be carried out safely \nand without impact.  But we are working very closely with the government \nin trying to understand this and see if there should be any changes quickly. TAPPER:  All right.  Lamar McKay, thank you so much for joining us.  \nWe really appreciate your time. MCKAY:  Thank you. TAPPER:  And we're now joined by a powerhouse roundtable.  As \nalways, George Will, from the National Action Network, the Reverend Al \nSharpton, from HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Bill Maher, former \nBush adviser Matthew Dowd, and Katrina vanden Heuvel from The Nation. Thanks, one and all. George, I've heard some conservative critics say that this oil slick \nis President Obama's Katrina.  Is it? WILL:  No.  It might come as a news bulletin to the president \nhimself, but he's not responsible for everything, and bad things \nhappen.  This is a reality check for a nation that's ravenous for energy \nand has to be and always has been.  Getting our sources of energy has \nrisks. The Exxon Valdez called our attention to the fact that it's very \ndangerous shipping oil across the surface of the ocean.  Since the Exxon \nValdez, there have been seven larger tanker spills.  You can go up to \nWest Virginia, where 29 miners are being mourned today, and they will \ntell you about the risks of mining coal.  No one says stop mining coal \nbecause of this. TAPPER:  Reverend, some critics -- not just from the right -- are \nsaying that the Obama administration was slow.  The New York Times \neditorial board faulted the Obama administration.  Is that unfair criticism? SHARPTON:  Well, I think so.  I think that when you look at the fact \nthat, first of all, this has been an evolving crisis -- this did not \nhappen -- unlike Katrina, where you had a natural disaster that \nimmediately blanketed the whole area and we were watching it live on \ntelevision, this got worse over time. And I think that there's evidence that the White House has put out \n-- I've not talked to them, but I've read this on their Web site -- of \nhow they met each rising crisis with personnel there, cabinet members \nthere, now the president going, unlike George Bush, that said he didn't \nsee the crisis, and we sat there four or five days and watched it live \non television.  So I think any analogy is absolutely ridiculous. TAPPER:  Bill, I was watching your show Friday night... MAHER:  Morning. TAPPER:  ... and you said, in language more suitable for premium \ncable... MAHER:  I promise I won't here.  They're so nervous about that. TAPPER:  ... that you're surprised President Obama isn't getting \nmore, shall we say, guff for... MAHER:  Exactly. TAPPER:  ... for this crisis. MAHER:  Yes, I think he should.  You know, he owns this issue now, \nbecause it was only a few weeks ago that he came out for offshore \ndrilling.  And I would say philosophically this is -- you know, the \nproblem, I think, a lot of people on the left have with this country and \nhave for many years, is that there's no one who really represents our \npoint of view. There's two parties who want to fight the war on terror with an army \nin Afghanistan.  There's two parties who want to drill offshore.  Where \nis the other side on this? So, you know, I could certainly criticize oil companies, and I could \ncriticize America in general for not attacking this problem in the \n'70s.  I mean, Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years.  We certainly \ncould have. But it is very disappointing, I think, for this president to be \ntaking a position, as he had -- and I guess he's backpedaling now on it, \nI hope.  I mean, I hope there's a flip-flop I can believe in there.  But... TAPPER:  There's a slogan for you, flip-flops I can believe in. MAHER:  I could believe in that one, and I hope he does. TAPPER:  Matt, where's the public on this issue? DOWD:  Well, I think the public -- I mean, first of all, the public \ndoesn't think there's any equal nature to Katrina and this.  I mean, \nKatrina, obviously, evacuated -- having to evacuate an entire area and \nwhat that issue was, was such a different issue than this. But I think where the public is on this, if you put this in the \ncontext of what happened in West Virginia and the mine disaster and this \nin context of Katrina, even though it was different, and this in context \nin many things, I think the public sits there and says, \"Who's in \ncharge?  Who is accountable, and who can -- what governmental entity can \nactually be effective in doing anything?\" And I think that ultimately is where the public is.  It's just \nanother example of a fact that we cannot trust the government to do \nanything that we need them to do, from mines to even a belief (ph) on \nhealth care to -- to the oil spill.  It's a loss of faith, I think, \nagain, in the government. VANDEN HEUVEL:  What we've seen are the risks are too great.  \nOffshore drilling is the problem, not the solution.  This is not \nKatrina, 1,500 dead, hundreds of thousands homeless. I think more important is to understand that we now need a \ngovernment that is going to regulate a company, BP, which was a serial \nabuser of workers and of safety regulations.  Just like Massey, we need \nregulations... TAPPER:  Massey, with the -- with the West Virginia mine. VANDEN HEUVEL:  ... tough enforcement -- the mines -- we need a \ngovernment that understands that.  I would also point out that this was \nthe week that for the first time an offshore wind farm was approved.  \nAnd George Will may not see a future in that, but I believe we need a \nManhattan Project, an Apollo Alliance to ramp up public and private \ninvestment. At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D.  We can \ndo better.  We are a nation which should do better, George, and not rely \non dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country \nand the planet. TAPPER:  Mr. Will, your name has been invoked. WILL:  Well, one in five steps of an approval process has now been \ntaken for the wind farm, vigorously opposed by people who are all in \nfavor of renewable energy elsewhere, because they think it'll spoil \ntheir view. TAPPER:  This is the wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts that a \nlot of people... WILL:  The wind farm on Cape Cod, yes. TAPPER:  ... including the Kennedy family, were fighting tooth and nail. WILL:  Right.  And -- and, by the way, wind farms kill a lot more \nbirds daily than are probably going to be killed in this oil spill. And so -- but I'd like to go back to Bill.  Could you just explain \nto me in what sense Brazil got off oil? MAHER:  I believe they did.  I believe they, in the '70s, they had a \nprogram to use sugarcane ethanol.  And I believe that is what fuels \ntheir country. WILL:  I think they still burn a lot of oil and have a lot of it \noffshore. VANDEN HEUVEL:  But, George, you're a man who understands there are \nalways alternatives in politics and in science.  We can -- you know, why \nshould we be relying on what we are now seeing the risks of? And, by the way, we can do better with existing oil fields.  We can \nget as much from existing oil fields, which the oil companies for profit \nreasons aren't doing much with.  So I just think we have seen the risks \nand we need to take action.  It is just too much to look at what is \ngoing on in the gulf and what will happen if it moves into the Arctic. And I agree with Bill.  I think President Obama was pandering when \nhe moved to this offshore drilling stance.  But I think this White House \nhas the ability, unlike previous White Houses, to understand and see the \nlight and take a different step. MAHER:  And could we have judges fact-check this on Brazil?  I don't \nknow... (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  ... dreamed that about Brazil. (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  ... and Brazil, let's get back to the United States.  I \nthink that Katrina's right.  I think that there's a challenge here.  And \nI think that the president and the country has to deal with the reality \nthat we're facing. And I think that the reality is that usually it's not about who's \ngoing to speak for the left or right.  It's, who's going to be right on \nthese issues?  We see what can happen here.  Now what do we do about \nit?  And I think that, clearly, a failure to stand up and lead at this \npoint is something that all of us would criticize. But I'm not convinced that this president won't.  I think he's going \ndown there, he's going to reassess.  And I think that we've got to see \nwhere that goes and if he goes, right, support him, and I think he will. But I think to act like this is Katrina, I think this is the step \nwithout -- beyond the realm of a sane discussion. TAPPER:  OK.  We're going to take a quick break and come back, and \nthe roundtable will discuss the far less controversial issue -- that's \nsarcastic -- about immigration law and Florida Governor Charlie Crist's \ndeclaration of independence.  And later, of course, the Sunday funnies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COLBERT:  There is an impending environmental disaster looming right \noff our nation's fragile coastline.  I'm speaking, of course, about the \nnew wind farm off of Cape Cod.  What if it breaks and we have a \ncatastrophic wind spill? (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (UNKNOWN):  And if the feds won't come in and protect us, then we \nwill come forward and protect ourselves.  We -- we have no other \nchoice.  We have -- we have a right, Greta, to feel free in our state \nand to feel safe.  And with what's going on, we have many, many people \nthat feel that they are not safe. (UNKNOWN):  Si se puede!  Si se puede!  Si se puede! OBAMA:  If you are a Hispanic American in Arizona, if you don't have \nyour papers and you took your kid out to get ice cream, you're going to \nbe harassed, that's something that could potentially happen, that's not \nthe right way to go. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER:  And we're back with our roundtable.  As always, George \nWill, the Reverend Al Sharpton from the National Action Network, the \nhost of HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Bill Maher, Matthew Dowd, \nformer Bush adviser, and Katrina vanden Heuvel of The Nation. Reverend Sharpton, I want to start with you.  You're going to be \nparticipating in leading a march and a rally and a vigil in Arizona on \nWednesday to protest this immigration reform law.  What do you think the \ncitizens of Arizona should do with the fact that there is this big \nillegal immigration problem? SHARPTON:  Well, first of all, I think we need to have real \nimmigration reform from a federal level.  The federal government is \nsupposed to set immigration policy, and I think that all of our forces \nought to really try to put the pressure there, which is something all of \nus advocated doing the last two general elections. To try and now say that because that has not happened -- and all of \nus agree it should -- that we're now going to have state law and open \nthe door to racial profiling is what we're objecting to and protesting \non Wednesday and have said since the law was signed Friday before last. And this, unlike many of the critics of those of us that protest \nthis, this is not about protecting illegal immigrants.  This is about \nprotecting legal citizens.  If you are Hispanic or thought to be \nHispanic in the state of Arizona, you can be faced (ph) and subjected to \nan harassment that other citizens should not.  That's a violation of \nequal protection under the law. We would not tolerate that to people that look like George if this \nwas a law saying we're looking for people that look Canadian in the \nstate of Vermont.  That would be racial profiling. Citizens that are here, that have -- that have not broken any laws \nshould not be subjected to anything different than any other citizens.  \nIt's not about illegal immigrants.  It's about legal Latino citizens \nthat should not be targeted, and this law does that. TAPPER:  Matthew? DOWD:  To me, Arizona is a sideshow, and it's symptomatic of a \nbigger problem.  And I don't think this is about the Arizona law.  This \nis about people in a state -- and it's out going on all over the country \n-- that they see a federal government that's unwilling to enforce a law \nthat's already on the books. There is an immigration law on the books.  It is illegal to come \ninto this country.  Arizona for years and years and years, including \nunder the previous guest, Governor Napolitano, has asked the federal \ngovernment to enforce the law, which they refuse to do in this -- in \nthis context. So it's not about a new law passed.  It's about a state says that we \nthink the federal government should enforce the law.  They're not \nenforcing the law, so we're going to enforce the law. I don't think it's the right response.  I think we need the federal \ngovernment to step up and actually perform an immigration policy.  But \nit's not about Arizona. (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  The federal law... TAPPER:  Reverend Sharpton... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... does not say that, based on reasonable suspicion of \nthe police, they can go after someone which targets people that are \nLatino, since you're dealing with a problem with Mexicans coming across \nthe border.  The federal law does not say that, does not target that.  \nWe agree the federal laws should be looked at, reformed, and enforced, \nbut to say that you're going to sacrifice the civil rights of Latinos \nand people of color because the federal government has not moved \nforward, I think, is very irresponsible. TAPPER:  George? WILL:  The Arizona law does not say that there should be racial \nprofiling.  And let me tell you what the... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  Well, then why did they just reform it over the weekend... (CROSSTALK) WILL:  Let me tell you what the federal law says.  \"Every alien 18 \nyears of age and older shall at all times carry with him and have in his \npersonal possession a certificate of alien registration or alien \nregistration receipt card issued to him.\"  That's been federal law for \n58 years. All that Arizona has done is say we at the state level are going to \nreinforce the federal law.  This is legal.  In 2008, the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, the most liberal circuit court in this country, \naffirmed the constitutionality of an Arizona law that made it a state \ncrime for employers to hire illegal immigrants.  This is not bizarre \nbehavior on Arizona's part. SHARPTON:  The state law does not say -- the state law says that a \npoliceman, under reasonable suspicion -- it did not -- it does not say \nthat in the federal law -- can go and make someone produce and document \ntheir citizenship.  It does not say what you just read... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  With all due respect, Mr. Will, that is not what that \nfederal law says.  And the recognition of that is the state of Arizona's \nlegislature just refined what they said over the weekend.  They \nconceited that we were right and they had to refine it. (CROSSTALK) WILL:  ... 50 years of case law refining the concept of reasonable \nsuspicion.  This is not a blank slate, Reverend. VANDEN HEUVEL:  Mr. Will, why is the law enforcement community in \nArizona so deeply divided?  I find that an interesting problem. SHARPTON:  Absolutely. VANDEN HEUVEL:  You have police chiefs who believe that this will \nendanger the public safety and security of the state and its citizens.  \nYou also have -- these are pragmatic, not moral reasons, even though \nthis bill is state-sanctioned racial profiling and draconian, ugly, \nmean-spirited -- but you have a $3 billion budget deficit in Arizona.  \nThis may well loot that state's treasury as they fight this bill. You're going to have economic boycotts, which you disagree with, but \nyou're going to have them, as you had them to push that state to respect \nMartin Luther King holiday. And finally, you have a situation where the crime rates in Arizona \nhave declined over this last decade, and you have a border guard which \nhas tripled since 2004.  The budget has increased money for security.  I \npersonally think the security piece is overstated.  You want to ensure \nan orderly flow of people and goods.  But you need a humane pathway to \ncitizenship. TAPPER:  Bill, what do you say to Arizona's citizens who are \nfrustrated with the federal government, the law is not being enforced, \nthere is an influx of illegal immigrants -- some of them, obviously not \nall of them, but some of them are involved in crimes -- what are they \nsupposed to do? MAHER:  Well, I would hope the Constitution of the country is a \nlittle more important to them.  I know that's asking a lot. WILL:  What constitutional provision does this violate? MAHER:  Well, I mean, nobody's been able to articulate a scenario \nwhere the police are stopping people for any other reason than they look \nMexican and poor.  You know, it kind of reminds me of -- what, was it \nPotter Stewart on the Supreme Court said about pornography, \"I know it \nwhen I see it\"?  That seems to be the standard the police are now using \nwith immigration. TAPPER:  I think what... SHARPTON:  There's something called equal protection under the law. (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  The law has -- the law has -- to be fair to Governor Jan \nBrewer of Arizona, she signed an executive order the same day that she \nsigned a law that said that a person's race alone cannot be enough to be \nreasonable suspicion.  There needs to be more than... SHARPTON:  And now she's come back this weekend with something \nelse.  So are we going to keep redoing it?  I think you'd have to \nconcede that had this not been raised and these protests had not -- they \nwould not themselves be now doing the moonwalk against their own bill. DOWD:  Jake, I think the situation is -- we keep falling back into \nan Arizona problem.  The majority of the country... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  People in Arizona have an Arizona problem. DOWD:  No, the people of this country have an immigration problem. SHARPTON:  I agree. DOWD:  The majority of this country supports what Arizona did, the \nmajority of the country.  And two-thirds of people in Arizona support \nthis.  Do I think that the Arizona response is the right thing?  No.  \nBut do I think that it represents a frustration with the federal \ngovernment, just like what's going on in Wall Street -- the people of \nthis country see Washington -- Democrats and Republicans -- complicit in \nwhat we do. We don't enforce the laws on Wall Street, so we have a huge problem \nthere.  We don't enforce the immigration laws, so states like Arizona \nreact in this way, which I don't think is actually reasonable.  But I -- \nit's reasonable for them to be frustrated with the problem. TAPPER:  Bill? MAHER:  The government intrusion, you know, government power is \nsomething that really bothers conservatives, unless it's directed toward \npeople who aren't white.  You know, I mean, it does seem like there's \nsome of that going on there.  I mean... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  Let me just interject.  To be fair to conservatives, \nVirginia Governor Bob McDonnell, a conservative Republican, and Florida \nCongressman Connie Mack have had some tough words about parts of this \nlaw.  Here's McDonnell on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCDONNELL:  I'm concerned about the whole idea of carrying papers \nand always have to be able to prove your citizenship.  That brings up \nshades of some other regimes that were not particularly helpful to \ndemocracy and civil rights. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER:  And Florida Congressman Connie Mack said in a press \nrelease, \"This law of frontier justice, where law enforcement officials \nare required to stop anyone based on reasonable suspicion that they may \nbe in the country illegally, is reminiscent of a time during World War \nII when the Gestapo in Germany stopped people on the street and asked \nfor their papers without probable cause.\" George, these are conservative Republicans, very -- I mean, nobody \nwould question Bob McDonnell's bona fides as a conservative.  And they \nare voicing serious concern about this law. WILL:  Yes.  To enter Mr. McDonnell's Capitol building or to enter \nthe House office building where Connie Mack works, you have to show a \ngovernment-issued ID.  I mean, this is -- this is synthetic hysteria by \na herd of independent minds called our political class right now that \nhas decided to stand up and worry about the Constitution being shredded \nby measures that have ample history of being sustained against \nconstitutional challenges. Now, Mr. Maher just said, if I heard him right, that conservatives \nbasically are racists and they like government intrusion only against \npeople who aren't white.  I mean, that's the level... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  We'll come to you in one second... (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  Can you -- can you imagine if some of the -- what's going on \nwith the Tea Party rallies, if they were a group of black people, you \nknow, waving guns, coming up armed, talking about how you might -- you \nknow, hinting about how you might have to take matters into your own \nhands if the government doesn't do what you want?  Do you think the \nreaction in this country would be... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... very important point that needs to be addressed.  \nWhen you say, Mr. Will, that if you go to Mr. McDonnell's building or \nCongressman Mack's building, you have to show ID, that is the point.  \nEveryone has to show ID.  They do not have guards stand there and say, \n\"Only you that I deem to be reasonably suspect because I think you come \nfrom a particular group that may be entering the building to do harm, \nwe're going to search you.\"  Everyone is searched. This is not the case in the Arizona law.  This is not the case of \nwhat's going on in the raids with Sheriff Arpaio there.  And this is not \nwhat we're protesting.  If everyone was subjected to that, like the \nbuildings you referred to, there would be no cause for concern. VANDEN HEUVEL:  And for George to talk about synthetic hysteria, I \nmean, your colleague at the Washington Post, Michael Gerson, took \nserious issue with the column you wrote underneath, saying that this \nissue is going to sort Republicans and conservatives politically, morally. I think Latino-bashing, which is what this is, is ultimately \npolitical suicide for the Republican Party.  I also think... WILL:  Have you read the Democratic immigration bill? VANDEN HEUVEL:  I also think that, on the media front, I very much \nhope that Reverend Sharpton's march in Arizona next week, as the marches \non Wall Street demanding accountability for jobs lost and greed, what \nit's done to this country, get the same attention as six Tea Partiers \namassed on a corner get in the media. (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  Let me defend myself, because I was -- just what he said \nabout rephrasing my -- I would never say -- and I have never said, \nbecause it's not true -- that Republicans, all Republicans are racist.  \nThat would be silly and wrong.  But nowadays, if you are racist, you're \nprobably a Republican. TAPPER:  Well, let's leave that... (CROSSTALK) MAHER:  And that is quite different. TAPPER:  Let's leave that topic -- that's a -- that's a whole other \nroundtable conversation. But, George, you did bring up a topic about the Democratic \nimmigration reform bill that I wanted to touch on, because Democrats are \nnow shopping around -- they're trying to find Republican co-sponsors for \ntheir immigration reform bill.  And it is a tough immigration reform \nbill.  I mean, it does have a path to citizenship, but it also has some \ntough measures in there. WILL:  It says enforcement first, close the border, later we will \nworry about comprehensive reform.  It could have been written by \nRepublicans. TAPPER:  And, also, part of it is -- and, Bill, you touched on this \non your show the other night -- is it has a national ID card.  Here's \npart of the Democratic bill that says, \"The card will possess biometric \nidentifiers in the form of templates that definitively tie the \nindividual user to the identity credential within five years of the date \nof enactment.  This fraud-proof Social Security card will serve as the \nsole acceptable document to be produced by an employee to an employer \nfor employment verification purposes.\" This is the Democratic bill. SHARPTON:  So I'm sure Mr. Will is going to endorse that this \nmorning and make news. TAPPER:  Well, but do you have an issue with that? SHARPTON:  I'm asking him. TAPPER:  But I'm asking you, and it's my show.  Do you -- do you -- \ndo you... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  Do you have an issue with that? SHARPTON:  I would have some very serious questions about some of \nthe aspects of the Democratic bill, but I'm going to see what ultimately \nends up being the Democratic bill.  And I'm sure a lot of us in the \ncivil rights community will question parts of it. What I go back to, though, it is interesting to me that those on the \nright that is headed by Brother Will here has not cheered this on.  If \nhe said it could have been written by a Republican, then why didn't he \nwrite in his column this morning that he supports it? WILL:  What enforcement of immigration laws do you support? SHARPTON:  You don't answer a question with a question.  I'm asking \nyou, would you support the bill... (CROSSTALK) WILL:  Let the record show... (CROSSTALK) WILL:  Let the record show that the Reverend Sharpton stipulates no \nenforcement... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... answer to my question. (CROSSTALK) VANDEN HEUVEL:  ... overweighted on enforcement. SHARPTON:  Absolutely. VANDEN HEUVEL:  By the way, I think the security card is a \nnon-starter, because you have the coalition of privacy advocates meeting \nthose who are deeply suspicious of government.  I don't think that goes \nanywhere. But I do think we need to fight for a comprehensive reform bill, and \nthe Republicans are not signing on anything. DOWD:  OK, so -- so we can give some proper history to this, the \nfirst person to really offer and push for comprehensive immigration \nreform was George W. Bush, which the Democrats and every -- at every \nplace and every time on everything tried to stop.  To me... VANDEN HEUVEL:  Not Senator Kennedy. DOWD:  ... if we don't -- to me, this conversation is another \nexample why people that tune in and people that think they're going to \nget an answer from Washington, from Democrats or Republicans, on almost \nany issue, whether it's protecting the environment, whether it's \nstopping things on Wall Street, whether it's immigration reform, whether \nit's enforcement of any law, that is why they're fed up. Now, we can discount the Tea Party movement and say, \"Oh, they're a \nbunch of crazies.\"  They are symptomatic of a situation in the country \nwhich has lost total faith and trust in what goes on... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  We only have -- Katrina, I'm sorry -- we only have 30 more \nseconds, and, Bill, I do want to give you the last word to respond to \nGeorge.  What should be done to protect the border? MAHER:  I pass. (CROSSTALK) VANDEN HEUVEL:  There are other movements -- there are other \nmovements outside of Washington.  You talked just about the Tea \nPartiers.  The thousands who've massed this past week to protest what \nWall Street has done to our economy... SHARPTON:  Absolutely. VANDEN HEUVEL:  ... the immigration rights marches... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  There are clear immigration problems... (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON:  ... for opening the borders, but that does not excuse \nviolating people's civil rights.  One does not have to be sacrificed... (CROSSTALK) TAPPER:  Reverend Sharpton, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave \nit there. SHARPTON:  And it's your show. TAPPER:  And it's my show.  And you guys will talk about Charlie \nCrist -- we didn't get time to do that.  We'll talk about that in the \ngreen room, and the roundtable will continue in the green room on \nabcnews.com.  Later, check out our fact checks.  \"This Week\" and \nPolitiFact have joined together to fact check our newsmakers, only on \n\"This Week.\" END. Copyright © 2025 ABC News Internet Ventures"}
