Partisanship and Presidential Support in the Bush Era CQ has completed a study of all roll-call votes during the seven-and-a-half years of President Bush's two terms — up to Congress' August recess. It is a first-ever look at the way lawmakers voted over an entire presidency. It underscores the high level of Capitol Hill partisanship that has been a hallmark of the period, and shows that while Republican support for President Bush was quite high, Democratic support was almost nonexistent in the House and very limited in the Senate. The searchable table shows both party unity and presidential support scores over the entire Bush presidency for individual lawmakers who are currently serving in the 110th Congress. It also flags the races CQ Politics has determined will be competitive on Election Day. How CQ Calculated the Bush Administration Scores | Previous CQ Weekly Coverage: Moderates Come Front and Center (July 28) Party unity scores for those lawmakers who changed political parties during the period may fail to fully account for their current position, since the scores show how often these members supported their current party, regardless of their past affiliation.
