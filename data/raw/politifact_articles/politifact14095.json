They have been operating as Robin Hood in reverse.  Stealing from the poor to reward their rich cronies. . . . I think what you have here is a case study on the proponents of the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party, and they tend to be left-leaning, how these people got together and figured out a charity where foreigners can give unlimited amounts of money, and U.S. players can give unlimited amounts of tax deductible money to an entity.  This could be a preferred vehicle for strengthening the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party and Clinton interests around the world.” Even though the Clinton Foundation is an official charity with a so-called “501(c) 3” designation from the IRS, Ortel says it’s not functioning as a legitimate charity. Ortel charges on his website that “Clinton Foundation documents omit crucial facts, include false and materially misleading statements, and exclude legally required audits of financial statements for each year of operation, that must be prepared on a consistent basis.” Ortel also explains, “There are two sides to the coin. I think Peter Schweizer (Clinton Cash author) and his team have done a very good job of exposing this very difficult to expose pay-to-play stuff.  I doubt there are criminals dumb enough who sit down and write memoranda in great detail and say ‘alright, you give me $1 million and I’ll give your this ambassadorship.   Let’s sign on the dotted line here.  Please wire the money to this account.’  I don’t think you are going to find those types of records.  At the end of the day, even if you write a great book, and the book is good, and even if you do a movie and the movie is good, at the end of the day, the skeptical press is going to say there is no evidence.” Ortel goes on to say, “On the other hand, on charity fraud, it’s a very different thing. In charity fraud, unlike pay-to-play, you don’t have to prove intent.  Under New York State law, in particular, the requirement is merely that you prove the public filings in the Clinton Foundation are false and materially misleading, and they certainly are. This is why you are starting to see these editorial boards around the world say wait a minute.  You also have to prove that they solicited, not that they raised money, that they solicited.  That, the Clintons have admitted. . . . On the charity fraud side of life, that is the mine field for the Clintons.  The second the IRS, or any attorney general or a state taxing authority, decides to make an issue of this, the burden of proof shifts . . .  the charity has to come forward and prove the affirmative case.  The Clinton Foundation has to prove, since October 23, 1997, that all you have been doing exclusively is furthering the authorized tax exempted purposes, which as far as I know is, to be merely a research facility and archive based in Little Rock.  Prove that’s all you have done.  Show us the legally audited financial statements.  Show us those audits.” In closing, Ortel contends, “This is a tale that needs to be told, but it’s not going to be a tale that people swallow at first blush given the fact how powerful the Clintons are or how vengeful the Clintons are when they are in power. . . . Another way to talk about the Clintons is the Bonnie and Clyde of charity or the Al Capone of charity.” Join Greg Hunter as he goes One-on-One with Clinton Foundation researcher, Charles Ortel of CharlesOrtel.com.

Comments Gina M Mancarella 08/28/2016  • Greg,  Do you really contend that this hit piece on the Clintons is fair and unbiased ?  What would you think if CNN did a hit piece like this on Trump ?  This style of mudslinging journalism is way beneath you.  I am absolutely appalled.  Regarding the foundation, their goal is to bring relief and by extension some social justice to the world.  Just because some people simultaneously worked for the government while working in a non-profit charitable organization doesn’t make it illegal.  I know quite a few people who participate in United Way or AARP Foundation or American Heart Association just to name a few.  It is not illegal and it is not fraud.  If you don’t like the law, tell your congressman and get a new law passed and everyone can readjust their model.  This Ortel guy is totally misleading and you should be able to see through him right away.  Recall his assertions that Obama is not a US citizen ?  Never proved.  Please Greg.  Please turn away from this type of egg nog jouralism before its too late.  Before Nooone takes you seriously. Reply Greg Hunter 08/28/2016  • Gina, With all the questions swirling around pay-to-play and emails it is a fair question to ask if the Clinton Foundation is actually functioning as a charity.  If it is then they can easily rebuff this story.  I have pulled the documents that are available on the Clinton Foundation website.  There is the original filing for the Clinton Library in October of 1997, and then a 501 (c) (3) approval for the Clinton Global Initiative Inc. in October of 2010.  That’s it.  Where has the money gone?  They must have records.  They are required to have proper accounting by law not just here but in most countries.  $14 billion was collected in the name of Hati relief alone.  The people in Hati say they received very little.  Where is all that money?  Let’s see the accounting for the AIDS relief that Clinton Foundation has been doing.  Charges of a massive charity fraud will be an easy thing to disprove.  It is not a “hit piece” to ask for accounting and records from a global charity who’s top member is running for President.  If you have a connections to book Hillary Clinton for an in-depth interview on her Foundation, I will be happy to give her all the time she wants to explain what is going on with her charity. Greg Reply Gina M Mancarella 08/28/2016  • Greg, lets look at an example.  Lets take the United Way for example.  Did you know that if you give a dollar to the United Way and even if you earmark it for a particular purpose, only a fraction ends up at the target destination because administrative costs are often very comprehensive.  Often only a few pennies per dollar.  Theres the bricks and mortar, energy, utilities, stationary and salaries among many other costs.   Yes, Some of the salaries may be thought to be  extravagant, but often are required to get the best people for the job.  As I am sure you know, Regional directors often require hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure their services.  Otherwise, they will just stay in the private sector.  Please be responsible when reporting things such as this. Reply Greg Hunter 08/28/2016  • Gina, If the Clinton Foundation is a real functioning charity, then ,proving this will make Hillary and Bill look like saints.  If they cannot prove it, then it just charity fraud.  It is really this simple.  I feel I am on solid ground putting this question out there.  By the way, I find it odd a “housewife” such as yourself, happens to be the very first comment on this post. Greg Reply dave 08/28/2016  • Greg, i feel like you have been really fair and unbiased regarding this poster. To anyone who reads your website regularly i think it’s pretty clear this person is a troll. Probably on the payroll troll for NSA, Clinton Foundation, etc… If it was me i would have been banned her a while ago, but hey it’s your website. 🙂 Reply Greg Hunter 08/28/2016  • Dave, Gina is giving us information and perspective every time she posts something. Greg Reply helot 08/28/2016  • For reasons mentioned by Greg in the past, and today, I am glad Gina is allowed to comment. Anyway, I don’t know if Thomas DiLorenzo coined the term or not, but every time I see the acronym, ‘CNN’ I think of, The Clinton News Network. Sometimes, I laugh. Other times, it’s kind of sad. I mean, how low can a, ‘news station’ and the people there go? Reply Mike from the North 08/29/2016  • I say let her spew as much as she wants. Remember that the more she speaks the greater chance of her tripping over her own words. There is little doubt to many of us here is that she is on someone’s payroll. Even if she is not she indicative of the lack of awareness of most of the US population. We live in a GLOBAl society now. The actions of the past can and will control the outcome of the future. This world is on the verge of chaos everywhere and soon the  USA will be in a state of CHAOS. In my humble opinion. What Gina spews here will have little to do with the outcome. The outcome has been cats by the actions of the past. PREPARE for the truth. Reply Greg Hunter 08/29/2016  • I agree Mike from the North!! Greg Reply Colin 08/29/2016  • Greg, If you follow Zerohedge.com, I am almost 100% sure it is the troll Milliondollar Bonus..Exact same type of language delivery. I find it quite amusing actually. Chip2 08/30/2016  • Note Gina’s nauseating endorsement of United Way’s expenditures – as if a charity giving a few pennies on the dollar to its cause is an acceptable practice. This is satire. The man behind “Gina” dislikes Hillary as much as anyone here. This is his creative outlet. He probably is MDB from Zerohedge. Charles H 08/28/2016  • Oh, yeah. Housewife is FIRST to comment? Exactly. Welcome to the Big Leagues, Greg. Wanna bet some of that Clinton Foundation  is making it’s way into Gina’s pockets?!?? Reply Mike Roman 08/28/2016  • Gina is not a FEMALE Greg.  The way this person writes, linguistically, its clearly a male that is attacking you as a troll.  This person is also not portraying themselves honestly or genuinely, one iota.  You really should ban, and simply not allow this person to have a post displayed here, again, 99% sure its male, to even show any posts.  It distracts from the content and value of your web-site, and also does not show how the ‘other side’ thinks.   Why fall for all the incoherent made up crap Gina spews ???   There hasn’t been one logical argument made, and its all, at best platitudinal rhetoric.  In other words, the person writing it is a) delusional , b) extremely deceitful, and c) writing in a primarily provactive and argumentative mode.  It’s all 1 sided fiction out of this namesake, made up name of Gina. What else is stupid about the dialogue, is this person is anonymous, doesn’t show any face, no address, etc.   The writer behind the fake name Gina, seeks to make a fool out of you on your own web-site.

Reply Anne Elliott 08/29/2016  • “Woman power?”  Get real; every red-blooded American should want “the best person for the job” – whoever that is regardless of sex, race, etc.  This is the top spot in the nation, and personally speaking, I don’t want it run by a criminal megalomaniac like Hitlery, who cares for the people under her like she cared for the ones in Benghazi.

Reply Mike Roman 08/29/2016  • GinaDude,  Ok, I’ll give a little and consider that you are rather a transvestite, and a male pretending to be female.  But your words, all of your embellishments that are super extreme (10,000 % female ??? WTF is that about ??? That’s an ego driven, male testosterone laden response if I ever saw one.) Typical of males, usually teenagers to exaggerate like that.  Using ‘baby’ after Woman power, and using power is again linguistically, a male expression. Especially it being a joke you are a ‘mom’ using those terms. All of your rhetoric, and grammar choices, is so very male, that it is impossible for you to hide it, and its also rather juvenile language descriptors you use in nearly all of your shouts at the audience here or readers that you are vanely just trying to get a rise out of .  Oh, and you are certainly shouting, by again, how your words are coming across.  Dude, you cannot hide it, and its quite obvious I struck a nerve, and am spot on, given how you responded, just like an ego driven male would.  The vast majority of females, have no where near the ego you convey, and are very rare to strike back so caustically or aggressively, (although Hillary might)  especially on a board that is so heavily male as this one is.  We’ve exposed you for the fraud you are Dude, so give it a rest, and go find another yahoo chat board to use your mis-guided notions of life to rant on to your hearts content. Reply Jackson 08/30/2016  • “Woman Power baby!!!!!!”  It’s more like women over-power babies, with 4.2 Billion killed by their own moms in just the past 36 years…that’s 1.25 babies per second.  That’s more people killed since 1980, than all the people killed in all of the world’s wars and health epidemics throughout all of time, combined.  Kind of restricting women’s “progress,” aye!  That’s not much of a foundation to build on. Reply Galaxy 500 08/30/2016  • @Gina  “Woman power, baby” I agree with the person that says Gina is a male pretending to be female. The above phrase is masculine, not feminine. I could be wrong and I put that out there. And Gina, Seig Heil. Heil Hillary. Heil Hillary. Here is an interesting article about your patron. https://youtu.be/xHhNr5jeTIw Reply Maureen Mizuno 11/23/2016  • Women gain self determination with intelligent thought and consideration for the truth not by voting for a vagina.  I’m always amazed when I run into a so called Hillary supporter. No one in their right mind could want her for president of this great nation.  That is to say a supporter either is part of the effort to take over the world with some or other agenda in mind or they are brainwashed students that stopped thinking on their and follow like sheep to the slaughter.  In any case God himself has given us an opportunity to redeem our selves from the actions we have committed either knowingly or through ignorance. I am appreciative of the opportunity at a second chance.  I am further amazed that you Greg escaped an Ivy league education with becoming communist, leninist or marxist.  God has his hand on your life and for that I am grateful Reply Frank D 01/25/2017  • Gina, what exactly is 10000% when 100% is all there is? Extremists have never changed the world. They have their 15 minutes of fame from time to time but, in the end, the pendulum swings back the other way. Its ridiculous, and dare I say sexist, to denigrate men (just as it is for men to denigrate women). Get over yourself. You and the extremist crowd will change nothing. Sweet dreams. Reply Deanna Johnston Clark 08/30/2016  • What’s even more obvious to me is that Gina isn’t even a political person…he/she is just a working stiff for hire by anyone.

Reply Tom 08/29/2016  • Most charities remove about 35% for operating and overhead costs with the other 65% going to the actual charity/cause. If the Clintons are only giving pennies on the dollar its fraud, plain and simple. For example in Canada: Under 35% Unlikely to generate questions or concerns. 35% and above The CRA will examine the average ratio over recent years to determine if there is a trend of high fundraising costs. The higher the ratio, the more likely it is that there will be concerns and a need for a more detailed assessment of expenditures. Above 70% This level will raise concerns with the CRA. The charity must be able to provide an explanation and rationale for this level of expenditure to show that it is in compliance; otherwise, it will not be acceptable. Reply Charles Turner 08/29/2016  • I have close relatives working at different size charities in the UK. Yes they do have overheads and a percentage of money donated goes to good causes and a percentage goes to overheads.  The poorer the charity, the greater they struggle to keep this ratio down. especially the charities that are dependent on 10 dollar donations and don’t have any wealthy benefactors. But overheads do not go up as a proportion of donation size. Given the size of the donations the Clinton foundation has received, they must have one of the lowest overheads to donation ratios of any major charity around. I can’t understand why they wouldn’t be releasing the most simplest of figures which show the value of donations received in a year, cost to run foundation, money donated to good causes ( in list form) and the surplus left. Also they fact they haven’t got audited books really doesn’t look like a genuine oversight. Here again a poor charity could be forgiven if they are operating on minimum resources. But a charity this wealthy should have  a team of accountants and auditors. It just doesn’t make sense on any level whatsoever.  If  she was just being CARELESS again, like she was with her email, god forbid what careless mistakes she could make with Russia and China if she gets elected Reply Deanna Clark 08/29/2016  • How do you account for the genuine unbought charities like the Daughters of Wisdom of St Louis de Montfort and to some extent, the Salvation Army?    Surrounded with USAid & Catholic Relief Services and other groups riding the  savannahs in spanking Air conditioned SUVs, living in lovely offices,,,the Daughters ride bikes and wear simple skirts and blouses.   There are genuine charities that hold their costs to a minimum to truly share and serve.  Another is Bryce Homes for AIDs widows  That they exist proves it CAN be done and with elegance.    Like Jesus, they live simply and go about doing good.

Greg Reply allen ols 08/29/2016  • greg; Monday, August 29, 2016 CONFIRMED Top Trump Economic Adviser is a Keynesian Billionaire vulture investor and Donald Trump supporter Wilbur Ross, who is on a short list as a potential Treasury Secretary in a Trump administration, thinks that Keynesian stimulus policy works to cure the business cycle. He writes today in the Financial Times: Both US and European policymakers have misdiagnosed what ails the global economy. It is not a short-run, cyclical problem curable with textbook Keynesian stimuli (and exotics like quantitative easing). He is also a trade Neandrethal. In the Finacial Times piece, he goes on to explain what “really” is ailing the U.S. and European economies from his perspective: The broader lesson here is that while exports do indeed create jobs, it is net exports that ultimately matter. When countries like the US and continents like Europe run massive and chronic trade deficits and countries like China do not allow freely floating currency movements to balance trade, bad things will eventually happen in the forms of accelerated offshoring, slower growth, falling productivity and stagnant wages… Europe has lagged behind the US in imposing countervailing tariffs against dumping, and is now paying a very heavy price. Bottom line: His advice is worse than that of John Maynard Keynes. Keynes was bad on the business cycle but at least understood the importance of trade. Ross is bad on both.

By\tRobert FarleyPosted on June 19, 2015\t| Corrected on June 19, 2015 Share6.3K Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina says that “so little” of the charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation “actually go to charitable works” — a figure CARLY for America later put at about 6 percent of its annual revenues — but Fiorina is simply wrong. Fiorina and others are referring only to the amount donated by the Clinton Foundation to outside charities, ignoring the fact that most of the Clinton Foundation’s charitable work is performed in-house. One independent philanthropy watchdog did an analysis of Clinton Foundation funding and concluded that about 89 percent of its funding went to charity.

She is not the arbiter of whether there is fire or not.  Just because we have entered a time where obvious irregularities abound and are ignored does not mean that she or the Clinton Foundation should be given a pass. If there is an irregularity with Trump I appeal to TPTB to vet him vigorously too.  I don’t want a criminal or a fraud in the White House. Please do not say “Show me the links”. We are way beyond apparent irregularities in many aspects of Government and Wall Street and I expect thinking people to be caught up on financial and political current events beyond the TV.

The communist media does this to Trump all the time and without any substance.  Killary has been in public life (government) for near 25 years- all this corruption she has done is while she was a “public servant”.  Corrupt is the Clinton’s middle name.  Killary, Bill and the brat should all be in jail, except the Upper levels of government are now as corrupt as they are.  Example- not one bankster has gone to jail for all the theft in the banking system, not one! If you’d stop drinking the left kool-aid it plane to see the corruption. If Trump wins, and I pray he does- all these leftist will see the inside of a jail for life.  What they have done is so corrupt on so many levels.  Trump’s Att. General will round them all up- Obama knows this and if scared stiff.  This fag is such a fraud.-  Ex.-  explain how does Obama have a Conn. social security number?  Impossible!  except his handler growing up was Henry Kissinger- who happens to live in Connecticut.  Weird how that happens??  This has been checked out and proven-  he is not a natural born citizen.  Birth Certificates put out by Obama were also fakes- that alone should have him in jail!! The republicans are also corrupt- that’s why they let Obama get away with this crap!! Gina- come back to the real world- your in some kind of time warp.

Reply Bobby 08/29/2016  • Bill Clinton once said he wants the white population to drop below 50% in the US so a Nazi party can never get in. What do you think of that sentiment Gina? Do you agree with Bill or not? Does Hillary agree with this idea too? Reply andyb 08/29/2016  • Those who call themselves Progressives, or Utopian Democrats are, in truth, Marxists who seek “control over the masses”,  for the benefit of those in power.  Gina’s use of the term “masses”  is quite telling. Regular people do not use this term, but it is quite common among the collegiate intelligentsia who indoctrinate our children with memes of income redistribution, social justice, and the abandonment of national and personal sovereignty.  It’s pure elitist condescension.  What these NWO sycophants fail to understand is that their totalitarian masters will sacrifice them in a NY minute to the revolutionary “masses” when the time comes.

Reply Rob M 08/29/2016  • CNN and the rest of the leftist “news” media IS a hit piece on Trump. In describing the foundation’s goal you completely left out the part about enriching the Clintons and the abuse of power Hillary’s appointed office led to through her connection with the foundation. You may know people who work for the public and also belong to charitable organizations but you do not address them using their public positions to enrich themselves through the charity. That’s non sequiter, lady. You are right, it is not illegal, but when it becomes fraud, that is when people should be prosecuted. The model you suggest should be changed is fine until it has been abused, as the Clintons have with and done so with a vengeance. Mr. Ortel’s “assertions” that Obama is not a a citizen are reasonable in that Obama will not open any of his records to scrutiny. Never proved? I opine that it must be difficult to prove an accusation when the accused is the most powerful person in the world and is bent on hiding anything that would disprove the accusations. Keep up the great work, Greg. Shills like this shrew use smoke and mirrors in a futile attempt at drawing our attention away from the obvious. And Gina, you keep up the good work you do cementing the argument against the Clintons and their dishonesty and criminality. You are your own worst enemy. Reply In Deep 08/30/2016  • guess who’s one of the best dam speechwriters in da bigness? Reply D2 08/30/2016  • Gina, please tell us how the Clintons, who were “broke” when they left the White House (Hillary’s own words), are now worth well over $100 million? Please explain how it is legal to deduct donations to a “charity” that is in fact your own “foundation”? The truth will come out. Even the murdering Clintons can’t kill off ALL of the inquiring minds. The truth shall set us free (and hopefully put them in jail). Reply Bob332 08/31/2016  • Gina: Go to Charity Navigator. They rate various charities etc. Since the Clinton FRAUDation did not submit ANY financials , records, audits etc to review they cannot rate them. The ENTIRE FRAUDation is  covered by   an opaque veil of secrecy.Predicated on ALL the recent revelation’s concerning the FRAUDation, including the through analysis by Mr. ORTEL ( check out his website Charles Ortel.com) to educate yourself BEFORE making unsubstantiated accusations.Additionally, it’s been reported that the U.S. Attorney for N.Y. is investigating the FRAUDation. IF, the IRS  pursued this corrupt entity, as they unjustly pursued various conservative non-profit groups, the CLINTON CRIME FAMILY would all be in jail.  As the saying goes….FOLLOW THE MONEY and you have your answer. Reply Greg Hunter 08/31/2016  • Good info Bob332!!  Clinton Foundation = Massive Global Charity Fraud!!!   Thank you for posting this.  I think people can see why “Gina” is so upset on the Clinton Foundation.  They all know its a fraud and really cannot defend it because the accounting is NOT there to do it.

Hillary is very good at debating because she’ll only ever say things that can’t possibly be argued with. She’d be a great president because people would be scared of criticizing her openly so she’ll be able to do what she wants, how she wants, and quickly. None of the rumors of people dying around her are true, but they probably deserved it anyway. She wants to be president more than anything else in the world. She’s motivated. She believes in free exchange of ideas with other countries, and the sharing of technology with less developed nations. That is commendable. On the other hand, Trump wants to keep lots of crucial US inventions secret. That’s not fair, and might actually be a sign of low level racism. Hillary is not party to low level racism and in fact looks forward to a US without white people causing trouble for everyone else, as does her husband Bill. Reply David Larson 08/28/2016  • Bart, where did you get that Kool-Aide?….you cannot be serious….Hillary wants to ‘share’ intellectual secrets with the third-world?…and just who is she to ‘share’ IP that belongs to private individuals or companies? 6-15-15-12 Reply Mike Roman 08/29/2016  • Look at this language you spoke to Greg.

Most big name charities are now managed by Wall Street  and cashing in on their “good names” from days gone by.   Anyone who gives a cent to any charity without seriously looking up the current records is a big sucker.    They, like churches, are trading on nostalgia and sentiment without disclosing a da*n thing to the donors. Reply Jerry 08/28/2016  • SURPRISE! G20 finance ministers talk about digital currency, and bank loans being backed by moveable property in upcoming talks. http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-08/26/c_135636979.htm I can only surmise that “moveable property” is referring to gold. If that is the case western banks will not be able to compete with the AIIB in the world markets come Oct. 1, since most of them operate under huge mountains of derivative debt, with little or no assets to back up their loans. Deutsche Bank is a prime example. In short the IMF is going to let the dollar sink or swim on its own merits in the basket of currencies when it comes time to compete with the gold backed Yuan. In some ways that only seems fair. But don’t be disillusioned, the BRIC alliance has tipped the scales with its gold purchases over the last seven years. From my sources, I’m even being told that the White Dragon family is holding in its private vaults almost 150,000 metric tons of gold, that it plans to turn over to the PBOC once the reset occurs to help salvage the world economy that has been dismantled by the western banks. Even though I can’t confirm this information, it does make you wonder when you see the Rothschild’s selling off their paper assets buying gold.  One things is for sure by this time next week, I’m sure information will be leaking out as to what will be transpiring on Oct. 1 when the Yuan slips into the IMF basket.

It lends credibility and (the one word I hate) diversity to his site. My problem is when I read headlines (like the one above) I realize that the rest of the world is not only disinterested in our politics, but are forging ahead with a different agenda. If the dollar should loose 30% of its value in the next few months, I doubt seriously whether it matters who will be president. When you’re busy trying to survive your perspective on life becomes very microscopic  and take on a new meaning. Don’t get me wrong.

I don’t think gold will be used in the infant stage unless we deploy our financial seals against the SDR. The last thing the Chinese want is to corner a wounded beast.

There are many fine young people who are in that situation through no fault of their own – and – saying so is a real put-down on extended families staying together under one roof as has been done for centuries and should be done by many to make it through the next down-turn in the economy. It’s a, ‘good thing’ is all I’m saying. And, no. I don’t still live at home. I kind of wished I did though, I miss some of the home cooked meals I used to enjoy, and the company.

He eats anything left in the house. Flipped one new car (totaled), abandoned a second (repossessed) , and is going for a used car now. It’s only “me”, and a lot of worthless talk. I’m afraid he will put the both of them out on the street. Reply helot 08/31/2016  • Dear Charles H, I’ve got a nephew, who lives with grandpa, too. He just started. I hope he does not follow the same path as yours. It’s quite possible. There’s an element or two missing from your family equation that many other families in similar situations have solved. What is missing? Religion? Shared work ethic? Discipline? Is grandpa to blame? I don’t know. RE: ‘It’s only “me”, and a lot of worthless talk.’ I can relate. I wished I knew an answer. Perhaps it’s found at Rock Bottom? What is missing? [In the background, I’m thinking: this ugly distortion is the result of easy Fed monetary policy!] Reply Charles H 08/31/2016  • helot, This nephew is the product of a “broken home” – divorce: well away from the side my wife and grandpa is on, who have been faithful church-goers all their lives. Also he followed Dad, instead of sticking with Mom and her string of ‘boyfriends’. Dad went through another marriage and divorce (4th) while philandering and descending into drug abuse. So this nephew has had it pretty hard. I spoke to him about ‘being like his father’ – but manifest in different ways. It went in one ear and out the other. He, like his Dad, made a “profession” in the past: and they think they’re good. The bias of the young generation frosts the cake. What is missing?: true Biblical Salvation. True change is beyond man’s powers; renovating and rehabilitating are just fresh paint on rotten planks. Reply Mike Roman 08/29/2016  • helot – listen here, and listen good. Obviously you are not reading all the trash mouth (the person who uses the name Gina) is spewing over Greg’s board here, but suffice it to say, that the clearly juvenile language, and word choices are highly offensive to many, and definitely words used by males. The person is antagonistic, baiting people, trying to get a rise, and inflaming post after post, and many video topics here that don’t need this sort of childish nonsense. If you think that person named Gina is an adult, be my guest.  Teenaged males, or quite immature ones use these words Gina has written.  Personally, the person named should get moderated off the board, because the person is not genuine, being dishonest, not at all considerate (rude is the operative word), even threatening Greg, and saying he’s going to get his ass kicked up through his whatever.  That’s how a juvenile in a basement speaks, with their buddy’s, not a grown mom.  That person is using a female persona, because if any male spoke that way, Greg wouldn’t allow such posts. I know from experience, as I have tried test posts here, and he never let them post, using far less aggressive and less rude words than this so called Gina has. Typical that he would, be more generous in allowing a female to speak, because they are so rare here on this website.

Reply Old Dog 08/28/2016  • Mrs. Mancarella, You are clearly upset, and you give the impression (whether it is true or not, I do not know) that you have an “in” with Mrs. Clinton.  Then tell her, a lot of Americans are upset. Tell her, a lot of Americans are “p—ed off” as you so crudely wrote, about her lying and her half-truths, about her husband’s immorality, about her self-serving so-called service to our country. She is NOT entitled to be president of the United States. She is doing everything within the power she has gleaned by hook and by crook to ensure that she is the president. If she gets in that way, she may get to be the first woman president of a country that goes into full-scale civil war. Because if you … and she … have not figured it out by now, a lot of American people are “p—-ed off ”  at corrupt Washington politics, of which Mrs. Clinton is queen. Trust her. Never. Vote for her. Never. But I suspect, you are as much of a liar as Hillary Clinton, and all your bravado is fake.

Now, with your interview, we have one more onion layer peeled off the Clintons.   Bill Holter remarked in his latest interview that Hillary would either be the next president or be in jail. For the past few weeks, I’ve been thinking what the next move by the Dems will be as they always stay 10 jumps ahead on strategy.  Specifically, I’ve been looking Kaine over.  He may well have been the contingency pick if Hillary should get her just deserts.  I personally believe the powers and the press will drag Hillary across the finish line — by her hair if need be.  After that, I’m thinking she is disposable.  Kaine takes the reins. There is too much money involved, too many people involved, too much power and all sorts of big plans for this country to allow this witch to take a direct hit in the next month or so.  When they rigged the election, they knew what their glue horse was all about — and they stuck by her and continue to play offense on her behalf. As to The Donald, he sure looks like small change compared to what we are learning about this foundation of worldwide influence peddling.  It would be easier to just off  Trump.  Nothing that unfolds in the next few weeks will leave my head swimming. Ya, I know, you’re thinking “truth, justice, and the American way.”  I’m thinking Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, reality stood on its head.  I’m too cynical but do hope you are the one who is correct. Election over McCain’s fate is this Tuesday.  I’m expecting a voter apathy win for McCain.  Hope I’m wrong here too. Reply Charles H 08/28/2016  • Not too cynical at all, DLC.  You’ve made a fair assessment here. Kudos. Reply Linda L.d 08/28/2016  • Greg: The Clintons are as guilty as it gets for crimes on so many breathtaking, head spinning levels, as I know you’re aware of.  But when I watched the FBI Director share Hillary’s email crimes for all the world to hear (something he necessarily didn’t have to do), and then give this lying, scum bag a free pass (warning in overtones that no one else should do what Hillary did!), then I knew that Hillary would never be convicted for ANYTHING. Hillary is in like flynn with the NWO gang, who are intent on bringing down the Republic. Hillary appears to be their choice and unless there’s a contrived, flag event that is big enough to stop the elections/cripple life as we know it,  then unfortunately I don’t think that  anything is going to stop them or the global scale, Clinton machine. Reply Linda L. 08/30/2016  • Greq: I’ve thought it over some and think that I may have jumped the gun.  My initial post (above) done in down moment, is what the far left want me to believe.  After all, they’re promoting all Sal Alinsky’s steps for collapsing the Republic, with one major key to accomplishing this goal done by smashing the hope factor and replacing it with fear/feelings of despair/chaos etc. We all need to stand behind Trump, giving this decent man a chance because the alternative will be the utter end of America.  Gina, you may be eating your words in the not so distant future, and remember Gina that it “ain’t over till the fat lady sings.” Reply Mimi Dick 08/28/2016  • Let’s hope that just ONE person who gave lots of money to the (cough cough) Clinton Foundation *charity* get’s angry enough to start pulling the string to unravel  this horrible couple’s fraud!

Great story and  thanks for all YOU do and thanks to people like Mr. Ortel for gathering the info on the Clintons as there is so much! I’m sure it’s hard to gather it all!

Reply Dan 08/28/2016  • Greg, Just wondering whether you believe it is realistic to think that foreign governments (US vassals such as Canada, Australia, et al) would actually take action against the Clinton Foundation. I would think that they wouldn’t want to at least for the reason of “non-interference” in the US Election process. Moreover, I would also assume that they wouldn’t want to be locked out of the SWIFT international payment system if they don’t “behave” like a good vassals (e.g., like with France not so long ago with BNP being fined $9b). Just a thought… P.S.: On the bright side, Trump will decimate her in the debates and there will be no place to escape or hide while tens of millions are watching. I get the feeling the elites/deep state will not let the election make it to such debates; something’s gotta give beforehand.

Reading all the comments sure makes this Gina dude look like he has screw loose or has some inside information s/he is not revealing. A line from Shakespeare with regards to Gina seems appropriate – “Me thinks thou doest protest too much”   Something is just not right right with Gina and the self assured comments and overt threats to you. Maybe Gina is overly confident about an election win because she is or knows someone who rigs elections. Gina dude claims your ‘Ortel’ report today is treasonist ! WTF ??? You, Greg, are simply providing true journalism in making points of view available and then people can take the information – think for themselves – and come to their own conclusions. Your work, Greg, is vital in a time in history when trur journalism is being subverted and manipulated.  Time listening to your reports is well spent . I think Gina must be a CNN devotee who had been mezmorized by all the talking bobbleheads yapping their nonsense from a common script. I don’t know if what Mr Ortel reported today is true or not – I’m not a lawyer but his accounting gives one an avenue to further examine -And-that avenue must be examined completely before Election Day. If properly examined then let the chips fall where they may. If it is as Mr Ortel says, then there is no way Ms Hillary should be president. If Mr Ortel is ‘proven’ wrong then this would simply confirm Hillary’s credibility. In th meantime I believe it is vital that you continue doing the wonderful work you do with your reports – I don’t always agree with all your guests but I’m given the opportunity to think for myself. I think the e-mail story and the Clinton Foundation story is becoming THE story of this election and will allow Hillary to sink or swim. The only injustice to the American people would be to fail to fully investigate all these issues BEFORE people mark their ballots. Stay investigative Greg ! God bless you and your work !

If Charles is correct and HRC comes under investigation for charity fraud and is compelled to withdraw fron the presidential race, then I predict she and Bill will receive Preidential pardons from the outgoing BO.

Reply Herbert Armstrong 08/28/2016  • Considering the content of Greg’s latest post here; [Clinton Foundation Largest Unprosecuted Charity Fraud in History-] I thought I’d add Johnny Yuma’s comment from last week on the lack of justice, in these less than [United] States of today. Is this the real reason for the unhappiness of the American people? LACK OF JUSTICE? Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” is a well-known phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence.[1] The phrase gives three examples of the “unalienable rights” which the Declaration says have been given to all human beings by their Creator, and which governments are created to protect. God has always rightly required that those desiring to gain his approval acquaint themselves with his standard of justice and follow it. (Isa 1:17, 18; 10:1, 2; Jer 7:5-7; 21:12; 22:3, 4; Eze 45:9, 10; Am 5:15; Mic 3:9-12; 6:8; Zec 7:9-12) Like God, they must be impartial, as a failure in this regard is unjust and violates the law of love. (Jas 2:1-9) However, the exercise of justice according to God’s standard is not a burden; man’s happiness actually depends on it. (Ps 106:3; compare Isa 56:1, 2.) This truth was acknowledged by the famous English jurist Blackstone: “[God] has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter.”—Chadman’s Cyclopedia of Law, 1912, Vol. I, p. 88. The proper exercise of justice by governmental authority likewise contributes to the happiness and well-being of its subjects. (Compare Pr 29:4.) Since justice will always be exercised by Christ Jesus as King of God’s Kingdom and by all those serving in administrative capacities under him, his loyal subjects will find pleasure in submitting themselves to his righteous rule.—Isa 9:6, 7; 32:1, 16-18; 42:1-4; Mt 12:18-21; Joh 5:30; compare Pr 29:2. Since 9/11/2001 we the people have been put through the ringer. Till the return of our LORD. . . We Demand Justice! Is there a new Sheriff in town?  A real hero. . . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGpS60Y2EY Reply your fan in Japan 08/28/2016  • Charles offered the example of Bonnis and Clyde.

Reply Dr. Bill Canavan 08/28/2016  • [THE REAL GLORY ] Real Justice? It is 1906 and the American Army fights to maintain control of the Philippines following the Spanish-American War. Sequestered on the Philippine island of Mindanao, the American soldiers help to fend off the hostile, attacking suicide  Muslim Moro tribesmen determined to take possession of the islands and their people. In this short scene from the movie you’ll see the native Philippine soldiers afraid of a fearless, death-defying Moslem Moro suicide terrorist. The Moro might have had better grounds to object to their portrayal in the film as extreme Moslem fundamentalist demonic, bloodthirsty savages but with 3 years of ‘ISIS’, ‘ISIL’ or ‘IS’ in the news, and since the Paris terror attacks last November, the word ‘Daesh’ has been used with increasing frequency by world leaders and the media. There’s a reason it’s gaining popularity. Daesh is an acronym for the Arabic phrase al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). Essentially, it’s another word for ISIS – but apparently one that ISIS militants do not favour. Why? Because it is similar to the Arabic words ‘Daes’, ‘one who crushes something underfoot’ and ‘Dahes’, translated as ‘one who sows discord’. In January 2015, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that he would begin referring to the Islamic State group by this name, saying: “Daesh hates being referred to by this term, and what they don’t like has an instinctive appeal to me.” It seems that other world leaders have now followed suit, with French president Francois Hollande and the USA’s secretary of state John Kerry both using the term. According to NBC, ISIS has reportedly threatened to ‘cut out the tongues’ of anyone it hears using the term. Evan Kohlmann, a national security analyst, told NBC: “It’s a derogatory term and not something people should use even if you dislike them.” So the ‘one who sows discord’ pop’s up every so often in history, trying to scare the wits out of us and now wanting to cut our tongues, if we call them out for what they really are! Everyone here, please watch. Let Gary Cooper show you. Come on, this is what you were afraid of when our American soldiers went home. You were sad when you should have been happy! Happy, because this is our country and if it is your country you’ve got to protect it. But you never will as long as your afraid of men like this! They think your only fit for slavery  and that’s because you act like slaves! Fear has made you slaves! Take ah look at them. If we were to cut them open wed find they only had one heart, one stomach,  approximately  25 feet of intestines, no more no less than you have, Then what makes him a better man? You, because your afraid of him! I’ll show you what your afraid of . . . Take a couple of minutes and watch this little snippet from a movie that’s been suppressed.

In fact, the Moslem Moro tribesmen were so resistant to .38-calibre bullets that the Army developed the 1911.45-calibre automatic to better repel them, still in standard use today by our armed forces, still stopping terrorists.

My family returned home in a euphoric state as though they’d been popping Ecstasy pills all the way home.   One of my brothers sat on my mom’s sofa talking about the moment when he shook Bill’s hand.  I recall asking my brother if he was going to wash that same hand ever again. The same dupes acted the same way when “O” was running.  They covered my mom’s neighborhood with Obama signs.  They ranted about how His Nibs was going to right all the pent up wrongs of the world, yadda, yadda. I got removed from the family E-mail list after giving my opinion of what “O” would turn out to be.  Everything I wrote came to fruition, and then some.

Gina might call efforts towards replacement of a population “genocide” but as a crime its like treason – you need to be careful who you accuse, right Gina? “Treason doth never prosper, what’s the reason? For if it prosper, none dare call it Treason.” Hillary loves that quote. Gina’s girlfriend told me. She’s really important. Genocide’s the same – only its victims complain, but they obviously deserve it. Why do they deserve it? Because they are bringing race into it. Why do people keep doing bringing race into it? Can’t they just complain about genocide without bringing race into it? Not that anyone’s really complaining in the US. Harry Potter just made a documentary about how to think properly. Saying Hillary commits treason is treason. Saying whites are being attacked is white supremacy. Thanks to Harry Potter’s new movie we know how to think and can vote for Hillary.

Also, I cant imagine that the Russians and/or the Chinese want to take a chance on her becoming president? They musty have some type of “contingency plan” . Thanks Reply John 08/28/2016  • Greg. As much as i would like to see the rule of law be upheld and that Charles is on to something. I must bring up something Comey said in his statement, that i feel has been overlooked. “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.” Have you seen any bankers in jail? We can still hope justice will prevail in the future. John, Reply MCasey 08/29/2016  • John,  In fact, James Comey’s statement stood out to me.  The word is “reasonable”.  The insinuation is you’re “unreasonable” if you think Hillary should be prosecuted. This is the #1 fall back in the Democrats’ “Play Book” to discredit “reasonable” people who expect “reasonable” action from their government. For proof, see Gina’s attempt to discredit Bill in the comments above, “Justice [DOJ] is not going to consider evidence presented by idiots.”  (Loving Gina’s desperation as we watch Hillary lose email by email.) Reply Angie 08/28/2016  • I will  be amazed if Hillary is ever convicted of anything not that she does not deserve it but because they have something on everyone else. https://youtu.be/F7ANyKS9ueA and still he was elected and reelected … now it is her turn.  She helped him and did what ever it took to get them there at the top and keep them there. What is most concerning is that she is worse than he is. Honesty, laws, and rules do not apply to them. With Hillary we are one hot flash away from  complete destruction.

Reply Greg Collins 08/28/2016  • The Clintons and their accomplices have been covered by corrupt courts and legislators for decades. My parents from the S.side of Chicago are multi-millionaires with multiple luxury residences in Illinois and Florida and are violent communist thugs that want to end property ownership for everyone except fellow communists/socialists. I started a construction company by saving my $15 an hour pay as a construction worker and the Clintons had thrown them into a homicidal feeding frenzy to strip everyone of property and they made death threats starting in 1993 to try to force me to transfer my assets and company into my mothers name and learn public speaking to tell her “success” story to the public since my unwanted childbirth had deprived both parents of the wealth and pubic image they were entitled to even though they were pothead, drunk hippie freak screw-ups with an open relationship and had all sorts of parties all the time and spent money like drunken sailors. I refused to transfer my assets and company to my mother so she attacked my stepfather to further loot his estate and he switched side and begged me to protect him and his estate from my mother. My father pretended to be neutral but picked an residence next to a top level Clinton supporter and my sister had the bridge loan for construction converted to a juice loan. She was a cocaine addict loan officer. I confronted my father on the issue as he refused to take sides after my brother had stolen my offshore boat and a sports car through title fraud and he claimed my sister had a right to do that because it was not her fault she had dried her brains on drugs and had many sexually transmitted diseases that held her back unfairly in the banking industry and that my brother was unfairly held back by his spending habits and great needs and that I was an unfair competitor and hoarding my assets was prevented anyone else from having any. At the same time my top level Clinton supporting neighbor told me I needed to have my arms and legs chopped off and wiggle around on the ground like a bloody stump because my hoarding of assets was causing everyone else to live in poverty. I asked my neighbor why do you live in a wealthy area then and she said because I’m here to teach everyone else a lesson about having more than they deserve and try to cause them as much harm as possible. I asked her why do you hate rich people and she said because her mother almost starved to death because she was poor. I asked the neighbor why do you deserve to live in such wealthy area and she became enraged and exclaimed she was extremely deprived and had far less than she deserved and told me that she deserved to have a mansion with everything she wanted in exchange for supporting the Clinton’s. All the contractors canceled there contracts and refused to pay out or even return phone calls and county officials stalled all my permits and many neighbors became hostile towards me and picked fights with me. My father demanded I transfer my assets to family trust and get on welfare to be taught a lesson about humiliating the family by being and unfair competitor and by never getting arrested, doing drugs, having children out of wedlock, credit card bills car payments etc. like “normal” people do. I refused and the family had Ameriquest transfer my estate to a Bank of America family trust they set up at the same time and had crooked cops, judges and county officials and citizens threaten, harass, falsely arrest, pick fights with me, ram into many of my vehicles and demand I leave Illinois and never come back. The Clintons and their supporters have looted, raped and pillaged the U.S. though estate, paternity, divorce, false  date rape, and numerous other property and business swindles. Combined with selling out to overseas interests treasonous trade agreements, fiscal and regulatory policies designed to harm U.S. business and getting paid off to flood the country with illegals by banking crooks that got rich off of juice loans and artificially boosted housing prices as well as reduced wages scales. The VAWA act by Joe Biden has been used to bypass due process and frame innocent men from coast to coast on bogus violence against women charges to strip them off assets and business interests. The Clintons and their rabid crooked supporters have done more harm to the world than any people in modern history. Greg your an international hero and a blessing to humanity for helping expose the most psychotic crooks in world history my dream is to have my mother, father, sister and brother shot for treason for being Clinton accomplices and go on a worldwide tour exposing them as Nazi’s on steroids. God bless and Godspeed. Reply Greg Hunter 08/28/2016  • Thank you Greg.

The couple had contributed to the Senate campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton. The pardon was granted over the objections of the U.S. Justice Department.  The Republican-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigated the matter and concluded that Tony Rodham had been paid. Another of Hillary Clinton’s brother, Hugh Rodham, was paid $400,000 for his work on two clemency applications. One pardon included the fugitive financier Marc Rich. http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/01/us/second-clinton-in-law-says-he-helped-to-obtain-pardon.html?pagewanted=all Reply Bart 08/29/2016  • They are creating Utopia. You want Haitians to have Utopia don’t you? Syrians have Utopia. Germany’s getting Utopia too. No Haitian should ever be forced to live without access to adequate daily levels of Utopia. Personally I think Haiti also needs more diversity. It’s too white. Obama knows how to fix that. Hillary can help to do it with just a bit more money. Please donate. 3% of your donation goes DIRECTLY to some people in Haiti. Gina knows the paypal account. Working together, we can all have Utopia. When Hillary went to Libya and “Came, saw, and killed him” she was hysterically happy  because Libyans would finally have access to more Utopia than they’d ever had before. Syria and Libya have by far the fastest growing levels of Utopia in the demolished world right now, all because of Obama and Hillary. In stark contrast, Trump wants to deny them access to Utopia and give them their old lives back.

Welcome to the new world order, same as the old world order I guess; where we have a class of folks above any so called laws and the rest of us who are subject to the discretionary and opportunistic enforcement of edicts. Reply Hatemail 08/29/2016  • There are laws and plenty of them. Laws are made to control enemies of the state.  The problem is the justice department which is under the control of the executive branch (Obama) is selective in enforcement. No way is Obama going to take Hillary or the Clinton foundation down. The game is rigged. Reply Robert Lykens 08/29/2016  • Brian, You’re right, how can something be judged as unconstitutional if the judges do not follow the Constitution themselves? America is finished. It was great while our elected government officials followed the law and cared about the Constitution.  But now all the Constitution is used for is to prosecute conservative constitutionalist citizens. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. – John Adams If ever time should come, when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in Government, our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin. – Samuel Adams Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.

My question is this.  It must be getting obvious to the elite that the writing is on the wall for Hillary.  They must know her odds of being elected are decreasing by the day.  They usually play this stuff a move, or more, ahead at a time.  What is their play going to be if/when Hillarity is no longer a contender.  She is their only contender.  They must have a backup plan.  She might be even more susceptible to ‘death in office’ than Trump, if she were elected (and install the VP?)  If she is actually becoming unelectable, how can they rig the election?  They need a new man, but can they even introduce a new contender at this point?  And how will they get Hillary to step aside.  Hard to imagine her going quietly into the night. So many questions but thankful to be watching all this from afar (Canada). Keep up the great work connecting dots. Cary Reply Greg Hunter 08/29/2016  • Cary, I have said many times Clinton is a weak and a very flawed candidate that is dragging an ever growing bag of dung.  She could not beat Bernie Sanders with more than 500 super delegates she got from donors and insiders.  The DNC rigged the primary and the Wiki leaks email dump proves it.  Did I say she was weak?  I DO NOT believe the polls because the MSM has gone out of it’s way to actually tell us it’s their duty to destroy Trump and NOT be objective and fair.  I thought they would have run Biden.  I do not agree with his politics, but his dung bag is the size of a lunch sack.  Hillary’s is the size of a construction tarp.  I think they still run out Biden, but time is short.  I also do NOT see how she debates Donald Trump.  She is going to point out his nasty tweet,s and he’s going to point out her global fraud and incompetence.  Who do you think is going to win? Greg Reply Galaxy 500 08/29/2016  • All I can say after watching your news broadcast is: Damn, laws are for the little people. Greg, we are no longer a nation of laws, we are a nation as outlined by Ayn Rand in, “Altos Shrugged.” Where corrupt men rule and the government perverts the info feed to the public.

These trolls are well paid to be aggressive against conservative sites and writers. I have had the pleasure of meeting them in person debating local issues such affordable housing and they a diabolical and wicked lot.  I think this charity fraud is the weak under belly for Hillary. No one respects or like someone who is charity fraudster and that is what Hillary is. You have to be an extremely sick, mentally disordered lunatic to vote for her. The real concern is that approximately 1/2 of the population will. After all, they elected the lying Marxist grifter twice as POTUS.

Reply diane s. 08/30/2016  • Did anyone see the Facebook post on the John F Kennedy JR. Plane crash connection? He was the front runner for NY Senator in 1999.  A short time after his untimely death…Hillary took the spot. Another coincidence? This is being posted today all over Facebook. Disturbing.

After all, they were poor for so long! They’re just like us! They really care about us! Wouldn’t you bend a few laws if it got you $$$ Hundreds of Millions $$$ ? You just have to believe that Hillary truly cares about each and every one of us! She loves us! She’s fighting for us! Her concern is not for “power”, it’s to get into a postion where she can really, really help “the little people”! What does it matter that she wasn’t completely honest? Those days are behind her, really! Just trust her! She won’t let anymore terrorists into the country, really! Besides, Bill deserves another crack at them tight young interns!

But then I was like, “what are they going to do, sick the DOJ or FBI on them? The same guys investigating the email servers?  the Lois Lerner scandal?  the Obama selective service application and (gasp) birth certificate and Connecticut SSN?”   I really was discouraged after watching Mr. Ortel make his case because of our rotten government. But reading G’s absolutely crazy blog posts makes me think we may have really something here as I’ve never seen crazy G become so unhinged. Greg, I really appreciate the guests that you bring on. I pray that you can can continue this good work and I pray for the safety of your guests who stick their necks out. You are like a  1956 Hungarian freedom fighter facing down a Soviet tank with a molotov cocktail . Reply Greg Hunter 08/29/2016  • Steve, This is for the voters!!

Reply coalburner 08/29/2016  • Gina’s attack on the United Way is corrct.  They send a very low percent of their take on to do actual Charity work.  For many. many years no one could touch the Salvation Army with somewhere over 80% getting to the actual assistance of the needy.  Thee are small organizations that can do better but none of the big ones including the Red Cross  I understand Franklin Graham does a commendable job but not sure his percentage output to the people in need.  Judging by history, Graham is a top choice for helping   people of Baton Rouge. That was all I noted that Gina said worth reading. Reply coalburner 08/30/2016  • Greg; Fantastic interview.  Mr. Ortel started off on a couple tangents and you pulled him back on subject.  Cannot help but make me smile and think about who is in charge. I mean really in charge not these vile criminals. Please ask him about his other good stuff and have this man back for another interview. WOW, what a scoop, just what Watchdoggers are interested in hearing befor everyone else gets the word. Reply Spurr 08/30/2016  • Her Hitlery is sick… very sick and I think she maybe dying… ! We better hope that Trump makes it to the presidency or else we will be stuck with Hitlery’s vice president choice for the presidency… Tim Kaines! Here is what a Phd and notable writer has to say about Tim Kaines! He encourages people to share this article so I am sharing it with you. By STEVE PIECZENIK. Democratic VP Nominee Tim Kaine: Pathological Liar/Jesuit/CIA Operative in Honduras! When I hear a Catholic political candidate speak, I am compelled to ask myself “what he is he really saying?” I double down on my doubts if that Catholic candidate was particularly proud of going to an all boys Jesuit High School. In fact, I am completely incredulous when a person like Senator Time Kaine waxes poetic about his peon days in Honduras while serving the poor and hungry, during the turbulent Reagan era of the 1980’s. Thanks to Daniel Hopsicker’s MadCowNews article entitled, “Tim Kaine’s Unlikely Biography”, I was finally able to understand the blatant lies behind this penultimate sociopath-Tim Kaine.This stuff will never be exposed in the biased-rigged-owned-by-drugpeddling-Mexican NYTimes. Kaine is the doppleganger to his teammate, Hillary. I should have realized that she would pick this effeminate-male-counterpart to her masculine-brain-damaged-assertiveness. Hopsicker correctly points out that Kaine was sent down to Honduras during the tumultuous time when the Jesuits were working with CIA summa cum laude operative, Ambassador John Negroponte. Suis generis, Jesuit missionaries working in Honduras would have been understandable. A Jesuit working in concert with Negroponte, then we have a Vietnam/Laos redux a la Catholics In Action [CIA]. Both these men created a scenario of “blood and guts” spilled all over cocaine crates and countless thousands of dead innocent Honduran bodies. In contrast to Kaine’s descriptions of living a simple, humble life along with Honduran peasants, Tim really lived like this: “Timmy slept in a gated community with restricted access and grounds that included offices, residences, a swimming pool, a country club, and part of a golf course. A subsidiary of United Fruit Co. had generously sold their company retreat to the Jesuits for its headquarters.” When he spoke of teaching students carpentry  and welding, he forgot to mention that Americans were shipping, at the insistence of Jewish neo-con Elliot Abrahms, [now at the CFR leading democracy studies], over $282M USD of bulldozers, weapons and military accessories. The reason Kaine and Negroponte were in Honduras at the same time doing the devil’s work was to create an illegal army [Contras] to fight in Nicaragua against the Sandinistas.“American troops poured in for saber-rattling maneuvers to intimidate the Sandinistas. American intelligence agents [Tim Kaine] trained Hondurans in surveillance, interrogation and torture……” Doesn’t this sound familiar to Vietnam/Laos/Cambodian veterans? CIA creates the ongoing disaster and the U.S. military extracts us out of it. Never one to miss an opportune moment, Kaine blabbered on about his volunteering “in exchange for meals and a place to sleep.” Sounds humble and touching! However, United Fruit Company [CIA cut-out] provided free passage aboard its planes, boats, cars, trucks for Kaine and his cloistered buddies; as well as, making a generous donation to the order of St. Ignatius of Loyola every year. Without a doubt, Kaine was also involved in the CIA inspired drug runs between Honduras and Florida, eventually creating the ten year cocaine-wars of Miami/Miami Beach.Those cocaine deliveries were so standard that the pilots called the CIA set-up, the ‘Trampoline’. “Planes touch down, gas up, and bounce back into the air for the second half of the their flight to the U.S.” The Honduran Generals whom Kaine knew extremely well thanks to his patron Saint Ambassador Negroponte, took a major cut of every cocaine load. How do I know? I flew into Honduras in one of our military planes. I stayed over and flew onto Panama where General Manuel Antonio Noriega outlined, over a three hour period, every part of the Panama/Honduran/Reagan/Bush Sr drug business. Unknown-7 Once again, Americans are confronted with a blatant liar just like his partner, Hillary. What are we to do? We know that the NY Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC will never cover Kaine’s fictional biography. We have to thank people like Daniel Hopsicker, Lou Dobbs [Fox News], Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh and many others for allowing us to open the gates of hell to see how many so-called “angels” are really dancing on the head of a pin. Sociopaths embrace one another in a certain type of fellowship where personal vulnerability and pandering for self-aggrandizement are joined at the hip.Hillary begets a Kaine who then begets a  fanciful story, placing both the Catholic Church and the studious Jesuits in Harm’s way. As I have repeatedly said: Clintons, both Bushes, and Obama are creatures of our insidious,  dysfunctional Catholics In Action [CIA]. When we hear the ephemeral homoerotic Jesuit motto: “men for other”; we are compelled to check every orifice and checkbook. images-6 I will end with the incredible tearful pronouncements of Tim Kaine: “I learned the values of my town: faith, family and work.. The same values of the Latino community here.” At least with Ambassador John Negroponte [whom I do like], we have a very clear-open-ended history revealing all that is required of an unique CIA operative.He graduated from Exeter Academy [NH] in 1956 and Yale University, 1960 [no dummy be he!].He was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity alongside William H.T. Bush, the brother of George H.W. Bush and Porter Goss, who served as DCI under John when he was Director Of National Intelligence [2005-2006]. On the other hand, the effeminate Tim Kaine, a Jesuit spook, took his ancestral teachings to an extreme.This is what St Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits pronounced: “Go forth and set the world on fire.” Honduras and Kaine: Burn Baby Burn!

Why? https://youtu.be/xHhNr5jeTIw I can hear the cries from the adoring fans as Hillary enters the arena. “Seig Heil. Heil Hillary. Heil Hillary. ” Greg, Wikileaks is gonna drop a load of pooh oh Hillary. The truth is always poison to Clintons. And Gina seemed to be semi successful in shaping the thought process this time. I agree with the write who noticed what I did.  Gina doesn’t write with a feminine style, not even a femenazis style. And I have known plenty liberals but I have never, ever met a liberal woman that would take time off from work to raise children. Never, not happening. Gina is a carefully designed  BS construct.

Don't you realize it takes a generous donation to  hillarys foundation before she would consider an interview.  Its not pay to play, its just pay. Reply Kerry 08/30/2016  • Another great interview Greg, you just keep cranking them out!  I found Mr. Ortel very knowledgeable about charitable foundations and certainly about The Clintons.  Sadly though it is not my belief that anything will become of this are any other investigation with reference to Bill & Hillary.  It is not just them but the entire two tier system of justice that is now functioning with this country.  Either you are an above the law elite are you can and will be cannon fodder if you press a issue to far.  The FBI set the benchmark for how far the judicial system will move against certain people and these two are definitely in the “do not touch” crowd.  If the IRS went after them the way they did conservative groups in the last election we might get some movement but that will never happen so I don’t get to excited about any of it.  I tend to be a neutral on politics but really find it disgusting when people give to charitable organizations and get ripped off.  The entire system has been polluted and is like a dying patient just waiting for the end. Thank you for your tireless work Sir……….. Reply Greg Hunter 08/30/2016  • Thank you Kerry.

He was part of a planned CIA mission to shoot people at a Gay Pride parade. He turned himself in to police once he heard Mateen was dead. He thought the CIA would double cross him too. A lawyer interviewed him. He implicated HILLARY. He said he saw her at the training camp with the CIA terrorists. Straight after that, the lawyer ended up nearly dead in a dumpster. She had a broken jaw, skull fracture, broken ribs and numerous contusions. She was close to death. http://henrymakow.com/2016/08/james-wesley-howell-his-current-status.html http://henrymakow.com/2016/08/lawyer-nearly-dies.html http://getoffthebs.com/brenda-corpian-expected-to-fully-recover/ Reply Chip2 08/30/2016  • Greg, “Gina” has derailed this entire discussion, while acting like a diva-worshipping homosexual man.

Don’t compare that foundation to The United Way. In addition, don’t speak for all of us women as some of us are content to be feminine women with compassion for others. Hillary represents ruthless feminism which does nothing more than to tear down the family unit and in a lot of ways these feminists are like ambitious men on steroids. She lies and she cheats and she thinks she is above the law. Reply Bob332 08/31/2016  • BINGO! Gina is one of the low info sheeple…to be ignored. Reply Terry Reps 09/04/2016  • Greg, As a former fundraiser I had the privilege of meeting many fine people in community, corporate and family foundations; really trying to do good for others. I would hate to have these people’s efforts tainted by the fraudulent and criminal activities of the Clinton’s. To spread the word I contacted the following and asked that they view the interview with Charles Ortel: Stacey Palmer, Editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy ( [email protected] ), Pablo Eisenberg senior fellow at Georgetown Public Policy Institute( [email protected] ), and spoke briefly to Sue Santa, government relations for the Council on Foundations (703 879 0715).  Lets hope that these people directly involved with the Foundation  world take action on behalf of their  members.

Harmon perseveres in his effort to make his extensive evidence available to the US Justice Department, while we continue to be maltreated by the New Zealand government in collusion with the United States. Harmon is currently stateless, exiled in New Zealand, and forcibly separated from me, his wife of 20 years, by New Zealand Immigration for 2 years 4 months…and counting.
